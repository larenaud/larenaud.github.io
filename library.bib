abstract = {Aerial distribution of oral vaccine baits is one of the available strategies for controlling the spread of infectious wildlife diseases. This technique has commonly been used to control rabies in wild carnivores and, together with other techniques, was used to immunize wild populations of raccoons (Procyon lotor) and striped skunks (Mephitis mephitis) after the detection of the first rabid raccoon in the province of Quebec, Canada, in 2006. Vaccine bait distribution was conducted over large areas where agricultural land is dominant but interspersed with residual forest patches. Our objective was to evaluate the effect of habitat (forest vs. agricultural crops) in space and time on the contact rate between wildlife and the ONRAB {\textregistered} vaccine bait, a recent alternative to the VRG {\textregistered} . Four transects of eight vaccine baits each were installed parallel to, and at different distances from, the forest's edge (under forest cover, at field-forest edge, and at 50 and 200 m from forest edge in agricultural crops) at three sites composed of various crop types interspersed with forest patches. This experiment was conducted during three periods (late spring, 1-7 June; summer, 27 July-2 August; and fall, 24-30 October) in 2009. Contact rates with vaccine baits were monitored for 7 days in each period to evaluate the potential temporal variations generated within the habitat types. Contact rates with ONRAB vaccine baits were highest under forest cover and in the fall. Of 13 species observed in proximity to the vaccine baits, raccoons were the most frequent (49.5{\%}, n=555 visits). Our study underlines the importance of taking into account landscape heterogeneity and timing of distribution when planning the distribution of vaccine baits to control rabies in raccoons. {\textcopyright} Wildlife Disease Association 2011.},

We also have evidence that microevolutionary change can leave an ecological signature.

abstract = {Understanding the mechanistic links between individual variation in life history and behavior is a major challenge in evolutionary ecology. Glucocorticoids (GC) play a major role in this link through their baseline levels into the blood and their implication in stress responses to environmental perturbations. However, very few studies have investigated the long-term joint relationships between GC stress reactivity, life history, and behavior in natural conditions. Here, we took advantage of the behavioral and life history differences among individual males and females of a wild population of eastern chipmunks (Tamias striatus): We investigated how individual exploration, age, and reproduction were linked to level and intra-individual variability (IIV) of fecal cortisol metabolites over a 5-month period. Our analyses revealed that female cortisol levels decreased during gestation and lactation compared with non-reproductive females. We also found that slower exploring females and females with a smaller litter displayed higher IIV in fecal cortisol metabolites. For males, fecal cortisol metabolites level during the mating season increased with the number of offspring produced and decreased with age. Our study highlights the necessity of considering simultaneously seasonal fluctuations in GC level and the dynamics of stress reactivity in the study of life history and behavioral co-adaptations within natural populations.},

abstract = {Quantifying animal contact rate is crucial both in fundamental and applied studies to understand the evolution of sociality and predict the spread of infectious diseases. Researchers typically use home-range overlap among individuals as a proxy of contact rate, assuming a positive correlation. However, very few studies have assessed how the correlation between home-range overlap and contact rate may vary with ecological context. We used proximity loggers to quantify intraspecific contact rate among raccoons (Procyon lotor) and explored the correlation between contact rate and home-range overlap in different seasons. We monitored 15 female raccoons that formed 121 dyads during summer 2010 and winter 2011. We compared contact rate with the 5 most common overlap indices: home-range overlap proportion, home-range overlap probability, utilization distribution overlap index (UDOI), volume of intersection index, and Bhattacharyya's affinity index. Our results generally supported the contention of a positive and significant correlation between home-range overlap and intraspecific contact rate in raccoons. The strength of the relationship differed among seasons and indices, being weaker during winter than summer for home-range overlap proportion and home-range overlap probability. When contact rates were high, their frequency had stronger correlations with the UDOI and volume of intersection index indices than with the other indices. Our results suggest that the UDOI performs better than other indices, as we obtained a good contact rate-home-range overlap correlation with this index with animals both aggregated and randomly distributed in space. {\textcopyright} 2012 The Wildlife Society.

abstract = {Integral projection models (IPMs) are extremely flexible tools for ecological and evolutionary inference. IPMs track the distribution of phenotype in populations through time, using functions describing phenotype-dependent development, inheritance, survival and fecundity. For evolutionary inference, two important features of any model are the ability to (i) characterize relationships among traits (including values of the same traits across ages) within individuals, and (ii) characterize similarity between individuals and their descendants. In IPM analyses, the former depends on regressions of observed trait values at each age on values at the previous age (development functions), and the latter on regressions of offspring values at birth on parent values as adults (inheritance functions). We show analytically that development functions, characterized this way, will typically underestimate covariances of trait values across ages, due to compounding of regression to the mean across projection steps. Similarly, we show that inheritance, characterized this way, is inconsistent with a modern understanding of inheritance, and underestimates the degree to which relatives are phenotypically similar. Additionally, we show that the use of a constant biometric inheritance function, particularly with a constant intercept, is incompatible with evolution. Consequently, current implementations of IPMs will predict little or no phenotypic evolution, purely as artefacts of their construction. We present alternative approaches to constructing development and inheritance functions, based on a quantitative genetic approach, and show analytically and through an empirical example on a population of bighorn sheep how they can potentially recover patterns that are critical to evolutionary inference.},

abstract = {Existing and emerging infectious diseases are among the most pressing global threats to biodiversity, food safety and human health. The complex interplay between host, pathogen and environment creates a challenge for conserving species, communities and ecosystem functions, while mediating the many known ecological and socio-economic negative effects of disease. Despite the clear ecological and evolutionary contexts of host-pathogen dynamics, approaches to managing wildlife disease remain predominantly reactionary, focusing on surveillance and some attempts at eradication. A few exceptional studies have heeded recent calls for better integration of ecological concepts in the study and management of wildlife disease; however, evolutionary concepts remain underused. Applied evolution consists of four principles: evolutionary history, genetic and phenotypic variation, selection and eco-evolutionary dynamics. In this article, we first update a classical framework for understanding wildlife disease to integrate better these principles. Within this framework, we explore the evolutionary implications of environment-disease interactions. Subsequently, we synthesize areas where applied evolution can be employed in wildlife disease management. Finally, we discuss some future directions and challenges. Here, we underscore that despite some evolutionary principles currently playing an important role in our understanding of disease in wild animals, considerable opportunities remain for fostering the practice of evolutionarily enlightened wildlife disease management. {\textcopyright} 2014 The Authors.

As a result, all tools available need to be employed when host-pathogen dynamics merit conservation or management interventions. Evolutionary principles, such as evolutionary history, phenotypic and genetic variation, and selection, have the potential to unravel many of the complex ecological realities of infectious disease in the wild. Despite this, their application to wildlife disease ecology and management remains in its infancy. In this article, we outline the impetus behind applying evolutionary principles to disease ecology and management issues in the wild. We then introduce articles from this special issue on Evolutionary Perspectives on Wildlife Disease: Concepts and Applications, outlining how each is exemplar of a practical wildlife disease challenge that can be enlightened by applied evolution.

abstract = {The current rapid rate of human-driven environmental change presents wild populations with novel conditions and stresses. Theory and experimental evidence for evolutionary rescue present a promising case for species facing environmental change persisting via adaptation. Here, we assess the potential for evolutionary rescue in wild vertebrates. Available information on evolutionary rescue was rare and restricted to abundant and highly fecund species that faced severe intentional anthropogenic selective pressures. However, examples from adaptive tracking in common species and genetic rescues in species of conservation concern provide convincing evidence in favour of the mechanisms of evolutionary rescue. We conclude that low population size, long generation times and limited genetic variability will result in evolutionary rescue occurring rarely for endangered species without intervention. Owing to the risks presented by current environmental change and the possibility of evolutionary rescue in nature, we suggest means to study evolutionary rescue by mapping genotype → phenotype → demography → fitness relationships, and priorities for applying evolutionary rescue to wild populations. {\textcopyright} 2012 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society.

abstract = {Sociality presumably evolved because it leads to fitness benefits; yet we know little about what drives individual variability in sociality, particularly with respect to hierarchical levels of social organization. Social network architecture is based upon dyadic interactions, but the factors affecting pairwise relationships are not necessarily those affecting higher-level network-derived measures of social behavior. We examined the influence of relatedness, age, dominance, and reproductive status on proximal associations and social network centrality of individuals in the fission-fusion society of bighorn ewes (Ovis canadensis) at Ram Mountain, Canada. From 2011 to 2013, 63-81{\%} of adult ewes were equipped with proximity loggers, recording when they were within 1.5 m of one another. Ewe social structure was not random and individuals exhibited a tendency to have proximal associations that were consistent across years. Age and reproductive status appeared to have a weak effect on network centrality, but this effect was largely absent for frequency of proximal association. Furthermore, we found no effect of dominance rank on either proximal associations or network centrality. We speculate that interannual variation in these relationships may be indicative of predation affecting social dynamics. The disconnect between determinants that affect the costs and benefits of dyadic associations and those that emerge from network-derived behaviors highlights the importance of testing effects at multiple levels of social organization in animal societies.},

abstract = {Animals are organized in a wide range of social structures. Variability in sociality is found both within and among species and is influenced by extrinsic and intrinsic factors. Here we examine the interplay between social behaviour, social thermoregulation and kinship in shaping sociality. We do so for raccoon Procyon lotor, a species suggested to exhibit flexible sociality - from solitary to highly gregarious. We hypothesize that this variation in sociality is driven by environmental conditions, relatedness and their interaction. We used proximity-logging telemetry collars to quantify intraspecific encounters and infer social behaviour among female raccoons. We tested the effect of extrinsic (season and temperature) and intrinsic (pairwise relatedness) variables on proximity. We monitored 15 female raccoons from April 2010 to August 2011, which composed 120 dyads. Daily proximal encounter rate was eight times higher in winter (mean ± standard error: 24.1 ± 4.2) than in summer (3.0 ± 2.6) and daily encounter duration was 12 times longer in winter (558.8 ± 130.3s) than in summer (43.4 ± 33.1s). We also found a negative relationship between ambient temperature and proximal encounter rate, which suggested that female raccoons use social thermoregulation as a mechanism to reduce energetic costs in cold environments. Finally, we found that relatedness was positively correlated with encounter rate during summer and winter. Our results suggest that ecological factors, such as seasonality, may affect the evolution of sociality in temperate species, and that the evolution of social thermoregulation in raccoons is likely driven by kin selection. {\textcopyright} 2013 The Zoological Society of London.},

The effect of human-driven changes on raccoon mass varied with age, sex, and spatial scale, suggesting that anthropogenic changes affect raccoons differentially according to gender and life stages. Human activity had consistently opposing effects between the sexes. Weather covariates represented {\textgreater}50{\%} of the total variance in body mass explained by our models. Previous winter severity and mean annual precipitation affected body mass negatively and positively, respectively.

We modelled cub survival before, during and after the mating season. We used three proxies to evaluate spatial and temporal variation in male turnover; distance and timing of the closest male killed and number of males that died around a female's home range centre. Male removal decreased cub survival only during the mating season, as expected in seasonal breeders with SSI. Cub survival increased with distance to the closest male killed within the previous 1{\textperiodcentered}5 years, and it was lower when the closest male killed was removed 1{\textperiodcentered}5 instead of 0{\textperiodcentered}5 year earlier. We did not detect an effect of the number of males killed. Our results support the hypothesis that social restructuring due to hunting can reduce recruitment and suggest that the distribution of the male deaths might be more important than the overall number of males that die. As the removal of individuals through hunting is typically not homogenously distributed across the landscape, spatial heterogeneity in hunting pressure may cause source–sink dynamics, with lower recruitment in areas of high human-induced mortality.},

abstract = {Consistent individual behavioural differences in exploration, docility and boldness are often correlated and are associated with differences in short-term neurophysiological responses to environmental perturbations in many animal species. These physiological mechanisms are much less studied over longer periods in wild populations. Here we report the relationships among exploration, docility measured in open-field tests and trappability, taken as an index of boldness, in a wild population of eastern chipmunks and investigate whether behavioural differences among individuals are associated with differences in autonomic nervous system reactivity. We also assess the cortisol level of individuals over several months to investigate whether chipmunks with different exploration levels display different mean cortisol levels or differences in their cortisol variability. Open-field tests showed consistent individual differences in exploration patterns (ranging from fast to slow). Faster explorers were less docile when handled and were trapped more often (males) or farther from their burrows (females) than slower explorers. Fast explorers also showed a higher sympathetic activity under restraint but more stable cortisol levels over the course of the active season, suggesting a lower hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal reactivity. Our results show that chipmunks display individual behavioural variation and that these differences may have physiological implications over long periods in natural settings. Future studies should investigate the fitness consequences of such behavioural/physiological differences. {\textcopyright} 2012 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.},

abstract = {Understanding how climate influences ecosystems represents a challenge in ecology and natural resource management. Although we know that climate affects plant phenology and herbivore performances at any single site, no study has directly coupled the topography-climate interaction (i.e. the climatological downscaling process) with large-scale vegetation dynamics and animal performances. Here we show how climatic variability (measured by the North Atlantic oscillation 'NAO') interacts with local topography in determining the vegetative greenness (as measured by the normalized difference vegetation index 'NDVI') and the body masses and seasonal movements of red deer (Cervus elaphus) in Norway. Warm springs induced an earlier onset of vegetation, resulting in earlier migration and higher body masses. Increasing values of the winter-NAO corresponded to less snow at low altitude (warmer, more precipitation results in more rain), but more snow at high altitude (colder, more precipitation corresponds to more snow) relative to winters with low winter-NAO. An increasing NAO thus results in a spatially more variable phenology, offering migrating deer an extended period with access to high-quality forage leading to increased body mass. Our results emphasize the importance of incorporating spring as well as the interaction between winter climate and topography when aiming at understanding how plant and animal respond to climate change. {\textcopyright} 2005 The Royal Society.},

abstract = {Predicting the geographic spread of wildlife epidemics requires knowledge about the movement patterns of disease hosts or vectors. The field of landscape genetics provides valuable approaches to study dispersal indirectly, which in turn may be used to understand patterns of disease spread. Here, we applied landscape genetic analyses and spatially explicit models to identify the potential path of raccoon rabies spread in a mesocarnivore community. We used relatedness estimates derived from microsatellite genotypes of raccoons and striped skunks to investigate their dispersal patterns in a heterogeneous landscape composed predominantly of agricultural, forested and residential areas. Samples were collected in an area covering 22 000 km2 in southern Qu{\'{e}}bec, where the raccoon rabies variant (RRV) was first detected in 2006. Multiple regressions on distance matrices revealed that genetic distance among male raccoons was strictly a function of geographic distance, while dispersal in female raccoons was significantly reduced by the presence of agricultural fields. In skunks, our results suggested that dispersal is increased in edge habitats between fields and forest fragments in both males and females. Resistance modelling allowed us to identify likely dispersal corridors used by these two rabies hosts, which may prove especially helpful for surveillance and control (e.g. oral vaccination) activities. {\textcopyright} 2014 The Authors.

abstract = {Determining how migratory animals are spatially connected between breeding and non-breeding periods is essential for predicting the effects of environmental change and for developing optimal conservation strategies. Yet, despite recent advances in tracking technology, we lack comprehensive information on the spatial structure of migratory networks across a species' range, particularly for small-bodied, long-distance migratory animals. We constructed a migratory network for a songbird and used network-based metrics to characterize the spatial structure and prioritize regions for conservation. The network was constructed using year-round movements derived from 133 archival light-level geolocators attached to Tree Swallows (Tachycineta bicolor) originating from 12 breeding sites across their North American breeding range. From these breeding sites, we identified 10 autumn stopover nodes (regions) in North America, 13 non-breeding nodes located around the Gulf of Mexico, Mexico, Florida, and the Caribbean, and 136 unique edges (migratory routes) connecting nodes. We found strong migratory connectivity between breeding and autumn stopover sites and moderate migratory connectivity between the breeding and non-breeding sites. We identified three distinct “communities” of nodes that corresponded to western, central, and eastern North American flyways. Several regions were important for maintaining network connectivity, with South Florida and Louisiana as the top ranked non-breeding nodes and the Midwest as the top ranked stopover node. We show that migratory songbird networks can have both a high degree of mixing between seasons yet still show regionally distinct migratory flyways. Such information will be crucial for accurately predicting factors that limit and regulate migratory songbirds throughout the annual cycle. Our study highlights how network-based metrics can be valuable for identifying overall network structure and prioritizing specific regions within a network for conserving a wide variety of migratory animals.},

abstract = {A problem in climate studies has been on how to treat causal chains of explanations and both direct and indirect effects. Mammals in strongly seasonal environments of the boreal forest typically lose condition during winter and gain mass (and reproduce) during the summer season when biomass and plant quality peak. Mass decay of large herbivores during winter is due to direct effects of winter weather, such as increased costs of movement, thermoregulation and reduced access to food when snow is deep. Deer condition during summer is thought to be affected mainly indirectly by weather through plants. High spring temperature speeds up plant development, and deep snow can delay phenology in early summer. Current statistical modelling does not take into account these mechanistic pathways. We used hierarchical Bayes modelling to more mechanistically link global climate, local weather and plant phenology to autumn body mass of red deer in Norway. Red deer were much more affected indirectly through trophic interactions. No solid evidence of direct effects of snow depth was found on autumn body mass. We discuss the implications of our results relative to our ability to predict effects of global change on large mammalian herbivores in the boreal forest. {\textcopyright} 2007 The Royal Society.},

abstract = {Time- and sex-specific summer survival of roe deer fawns was estimated using capture-mark-recapture methods in two enclosed populations living in contrasting conditions. The population of Trois Fontaines (eastern France) was roughly constant in size throughout the study period, while in Chize (western France), the population experienced frequent summer droughts and numbers decreased continuously during the study. Early survival of fawns was low and highly variable over the years at both Chize and Trois Fontaines, and demonstrated marked variations between cohorts that need to be taken into account when modelling roe deer population dynamics. In Trois Fontaines, fawn survival was positively correlated with early body growth and total rainfall in May and June. In Chize, fawn survival decreased with increasing density and tended to increase with increasing rainfall in May and June and adult female body mass. These factors explained more than 75{\%} of the variability in early survival observed in both populations. Variation between cohorts had different consequences for the two populations. At Trois Fontaines, cohort variation was limited to a numerical effect on early survival. However at Chize, cohort variation was long-lasting and affected the phenotypic quality of survivors at later ages, and thereby future survival and breeding abilities (both numerical and quality effects). Male and female fawns had similar survival over their first summer in both populations. This result contrasts with the lower survival of young males often observed in ungulates. Two ultimate causes can be proposed to account for the low and variable survival of roe deer fawns over the first summer: the high energy expenditures incurred by does during each breeding attempt and/or the low absolute body size of newborn roe deer fawns.},

abstract = {The ability to cope with environmental change is fundamental to a species' evolution. Organisms can respond to seasonal environmental variation through phenotypic plasticity. The substantial plasticity in body mass of temperate species has often been considered a simple consequence of change in environmental quality, but could also have evolved as an adaptation to seasonality. We investigated the genetic basis of, and selection acting on, seasonal plasticity in body mass for wild bighorn sheep ewes (Ovis canadensis) at Ram Mountain, Alberta, under two contrasting environmental conditions. Heritability of plasticity, estimated as mass-specific summer and winter mass changes, was low but significant. The additive genetic variance component of relative summer mass change was greater under good environmental conditions (characterized by a population increase and high juvenile survival) than under poor conditions (population decrease and low juvenile survival). Additive genetic variance of relative winter mass change appeared independent of environmental conditions. We found evidence of selection on summer (relative) and winter (relative and absolute) mass change. For a given mass, more plastic individuals (with greater seasonal mass changes) achieve greater fitness through reproduction in the following year. However, genetic correlations between mass parameters were positive. Our study supports the hypothesis that seasonal plasticity in body mass in vertebrates is an adaptation that evolved under natural selection to cope with environmental variation but genetic correlations with other traits might limit its evolutionary potential. {\textcopyright} 2007 The Author(s).},

Human studies produced mixed results and considerable debate mainly owing to the difficulty of distinguishing the effects of sexual dimorphism from sociocultural factors. To advance this debate, we examined how the relative number of sons influenced maternal longevity in four species of free-living ungulates (Soay sheep Ovis aries; bighorn sheep, Ovis canadensis; red deer, Cervus elaphus; mountain goat, Oreamnos americanus), with high male-biased sexual size dimorphism but without complicating sociocultural variables. We found no evidence for a higher cumulative cost of sons than of daughters on maternal longevity. For a given number of offspring, most females with many sons in all four populations lived longer than females with few sons. The higher cost of sons over daughters on maternal lifespan reported by some human studies may be the exception rather than the rule in long-lived iteroparous species.},

abstract = {In sexually dimorphic ungulates, males generally spend less time foraging than females, possibly because of difference in body mass or because of the energetic requirements of lactation. The relationship between body size and foraging time has received little attention at the intra-specific level, because few studies have documented activity budgets for individuals of known size. Bighorn rams are a good model to explore how body mass affects foraging time, because they range in mass from 55 to 140 kg. We examined how the foraging time of bighorn rams varied according to individual characteristics. We observed rams in a marked population and constructed time budgets during the 3 months preceding the rut. We determined ram social rank based on agonistic encounters and collected fecal samples to count lungworm larvae. Time spent foraging was negatively correlated with body mass. After accounting for age differences, larger rams spent less time foraging and more time lying than smaller rams. Among rams aged 6-12 years, dominants spent less time feeding than subordinates, while fecal output of lungworm larvae was negatively correlated with foraging time for rams of all ages. Body mass accounts for much of the individual variation in foraging time, suggesting that sexual dimorphism is important in explaining differences in feeding time between males and females. {\textcopyright} Springer-Verlag 2004.},

The objectives of this study were to assess the links between RMR, DEE, and two personality traits (exploration in an open-field and docility during handling) in wild eastern chipmunks (Tamias striatus). Using a multivariate mixed model, we found that exploration and docility were significantly correlated at the among-individual level, confirming the presence of a behavioral syndrome within our population. We also found that exploration, but not docility, was negatively correlated with DEE. Hence, fast explorers show lower DEE levels than slow explorers, independently of RMR and docility.

In this context, we explored the parasite status of this population with the aim of 1) assessing the occurrence and intensity of parasite infections and the spatial, temporal and individual variations, 2) quantifying parasite richness and investigating factors such as sex and host body condition that may be associated with this variable and 3) evaluating the effects of parasite infections on survival in the Atlantic-Gasp{\'{e}}sie caribou population. We examined fecal samples from 32 animals captured in 2013–2014 for eggs, oocysts and larvae of parasites and detected 7 parasite species: dorsal-spined larvae protostrongylids, presumably Parelaphostrongylus andersoni based on PCR identification of a subset, Nematodirus odocoilei and other unidentified Strongyles, Trichuris sp., Capillaria sp., Moniezia sp. and Eimeria sp. For each caribou, mean parasite species richness was 1.8 ± 1.1 (SD). Sex, body condition, year and capture location did not explain parasite prevalence, intensity of infection or richness except for intensity of infection of Capillaria sp. that was positively influenced by body condition. Parasites did not influence survival although mortality was higher for males than for females. We suggest that the relatively low and common gastrointestinal and protostrongylid parasite infections will not be a short-term threat leading to extinction.},

abstract = {It is often claimed that modern humans have stopped evolving because cultural and technological advancements have annihilated natural selection. In contrast, recent studies show that selection can be strong in contemporary populations. However, detecting a response to selection is particularly challenging; previous evidence from wild animals has been criticized for both applying anticonservative statistical tests and failing to consider random genetic drift. Here we study life-history variation in an insular preindustrial French-Canadian population and apply a recently proposed conservative approach to testing microevolutionary responses to selection. As reported for other such societies, natural selection favored an earlier age at first reproduction (AFR) among women. AFR was also highly heritable and genetically correlated to fitness, predicting a microevolutionary change toward earlier reproduction. In agreement with this prediction, AFR declined from about 26-22 y over a 140-y period. Crucially, we uncovered a substantial change in the breeding values for this trait, indicating that the change in AFR largely occurred at the genetic level. Moreover, the genetic trend was higher than expected under the effect of random genetic drift alone. Our results show that microevolution can be detectable over relatively few generations in humans and underscore the need for studies of human demography and reproductive ecology to consider the role of evolutionary processes.},

abstract = {Seasonal patterns of climate and vegetation growth are expected to be altered by global warming. In alpine environments, the reproduction of birds and mammals is tightly linked to seasonality; therefore such alterations may have strong repercussions on recruitment. We used the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), a satellite-based measurement that correlates strongly with aboveground net primary productivity, to explore how annual variations in the timing of vegetation onset and in the rate of change in primary production during green-up affected juvenile growth and survival of bighorn sheep (Ovis canadensis), Alpine ibex (Capra ibex), and mountain goats (Oreamnos americanus) in four different populations in two continents. We indexed timing of onset of vegetation growth by the integrated NDVI (INDVI) in May. The rate of change in primary production during green-up (early May to early July) was estimated as (1) the maximal slope between any two successive bimonthly NDVI values during this period and (2) the slope in NDVI between early May and early July. The maximal slope in NDVI was negatively correlated with lamb growth and survival in both populations of bighorn sheep, growth of mountain goat kids, and survival of Alpine ibex kids, but not with survival of mountain goat kids. There was no effect of INDVI in May and of the slope in NDVI between early May and early July on juvenile growth and survival for any species. Although rapid changes in NDVI during the green-up period could translate into higher plant productivity, they may also lead to a shorter period of availability of high-quality forage over a large spatial scale, decreasing the opportunity for mountain ungulates to exploit high-quality forage. Our results suggest that attempts to forecast how warmer winters and springs will affect animal population dynamics and life histories in alpine environments should consider factors influencing the rate of changes in primary production during green-up and the timing of vegetation onset. {\textcopyright} 2007 by the Ecological Society of America.},

abstract = {Although mixed effects models are widely used in ecology and evolution, their application to standardized traits that change within season or across ontogeny remains limited. Mixed models offer a robust way to standardize individual quantitative traits to a common condition such as body mass at a certain point in time (within a year or across ontogeny), or parturition date for a given climatic condition. Currently, however, most researchers use simple linear models to accomplish this task. We use both empirical and simulated data to underline the application of mixed models for standardizing trait values to a common environment for each individual. We show that mixed model standardizations provide more accurate estimates of mass parameters than linear models for all sampling regimes and especially for individuals with few repeated measures. Our simulations and analyses on empirical data both confirm that mixed models provide a better way to standardize trait values for individuals with repeated measurements compared with classical least squares regression. Linear regression should therefore be avoided to adjust or standardize individual measurements},

abstract = {Despite accumulating examples of selection acting on heritable traits in the wild, predicted evolutionary responses are often different from observed phenotypic trends. Various explanations have been suggested for these mismatches. These include within-individual changes across lifespan that can create important variation in genetic architecture of traits and selection acting on them, but also potential problems with the methodological approach used to predict evolutionary responses of traits. Here, we used an 8-year data set on tree swallow (Tachycineta bicolor) to first assess the effects of differences among three nestling life-history stages on the genetic (co)variances of two morphological traits (body mass and primary feather length) and the selection acting on them over three generations. We then estimated the evolutionary potential of these traits by predicting their evolutionary responses using the breeder's equation and the secondary theorem of selection approaches. Our results showed variation in strength and direction of selection and slight changes in trait variance across ages. Predicted evolutionary responses differed importantly between both approaches for half of the trait–age combinations we studied, suggesting the presence of environmentally induced correlations between focal traits and fitness possibly biasing breeder's equation predictions. Our results emphasize that predictions of evolutionary potential for morphological traits are likely to be highly variable, both in strength and direction, depending on the life stage and method used, thus mitigating our capacity to predict adaptation and persistence of wild populations.},

abstract = {During migration, animals may experience high rates of mortality, but costs of migration could also be manifested through non-lethal carry-over effects that influence individual success in subsequent periods of the annual cycle. Using tracking data collected from light-level geolocators, we estimated total spring migration distance (from the last wintering sites to breeding sites) of tree swallows (Tachycineta bicolor) within three major North American flyways. Using path analysis, we then assessed direct and indirect effects of spring migration distance on reproductive performance of individuals of both sexes. When these data were standardized by flyway, females fledged 1.3 fewer young for every 1,017 km they traveled, whereas there was no effect of migration distance on reproductive success in males. In comparison, when these data were standardized across all individuals and not by flyway, longer migrations were associated with 0.74 more young fledged for every 1,017 km traveled by females and 0.26 more young fledged for every 1,186 km migrated by males. Our results suggest that migration distance carries over to negatively influence female reproductive success within flyways but the overall positive effect of migration distance across flyways likely reflects broader life-history differences that occur among breeding populations across the tree swallow range.},

Trivers and Willard proposed that for polygynous mammals, females should adjust sex-ratio at conception or bias allocation of resources toward the most profitable sex, according to their own body condition. However, the possibility that mammalian fathers may influence sex allocation has seldom been considered. Here, we show that the probability of having a son increased from 0.31 to 0.60 with sire reproductive success in wild bighorn sheep (Ovis canadensis). Furthermore, our results suggest that females fertilized by relatively unsuccessful sires allocated more energy during lactation to daughters than to sons, while the opposite occurred for females fertilized by successful sires. The pattern of sex-biased offspring production appears adaptive because paternal reproductive success reduced the fitness of daughters and increased the average annual weaning success of sons, independently of maternal allocation to the offspring. Our results illustrate that sex allocation can be driven by paternal phenotype, with profound influences on the strength of sexual selection and on conflicts of interest between parents.},

abstract = {Current climatic trends involve both increasing temperatures and climatic variability, with extreme events becoming more frequent. Increasing concern on extreme climatic events has triggered research on vegetation shifts. However, evidences of vegetation shifts resulting from these events are still relatively rare. Empirical evidence supports the existence of stabilizing processes minimizing and counteracting the effects of these events, reinforcing community resilience. We propose a demographic framework to understand this inertia to change based on the balance between adult mortality induced by the event and enhanced recruitment or adult survival after the event. The stabilizing processes potentially contributing to this compensation include attenuation of the adult mortality caused by the event, due to site quality variability, to tolerance, phenotypic variability, and plasticity at population level, and to facilitative interactions. Mortality compensation may also occur by increasing future survival due to beneficial effect on growth and survival of the new conditions derived from global warming and increased climatic variability, to lowered competition resulting from reduced density in affected stands, or to antagonistic release when pathogens or predators are vulnerable to the event or the ongoing climatic conditions. Finally, mortality compensation may appear by enhanced recruitment due to release of competition with established vegetation, for instance as a consequence of gap openings after event-caused mortality, or to the new conditions, which may be more favorable for seedling establishment, or to enhanced mutualistic interactions (pollination, dispersal). There are important challenges imposed by the need of long-term studies, but a research agenda focused on potentially stabilizing processes is well suited to understand the variety of responses, including lack of sudden changes and community inertia that are frequently observed in vegetation under extreme events. This understanding is crucial for the establishment of sound management strategies and actions addressed to improve ecosystem resilience under climate change scenarios. {\textcopyright} 2011 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.},

abstract = {Trivers and Willard proposed that offspring sex ratio should vary with maternal condition when condition, meant as maternal capacity to care, has different fitness consequences for sons and daughters. In polygynous and dimorphic species, mothers in good condition should preferentially produce sons, whereas mothers in poor condition should produce more daughters. Despite its logical appeal, support for this hypothesis has been inconsistent. Sex-ratio variation may be influenced by additional factors, such as environmental conditions and previous reproduction, which are often ignored in empirical studies. We analysed 39 years of data on bighorn sheep (Ovis canadensis) that fit all the assumptions of the Trivers-Willard hypothesis. Production of sons increased with maternal condition only for mothers that weaned a son the previous year. This relationship likely reflects a mother's ability to bear the higher reproductive costs of sons. The interaction between maternal condition and previous weaning success on the probability of producing a son was independent of the positive effect of paternal reproductive success. Maternal and paternal effects accounted for similar proportions of the variance in offspring sex. Maternal reproductive history should be considered in addition to current condition in studies of sex allocation.},

abstract = {Recently, the results from several long-term individual-based population studies of ungulates have been published. One major conclusion is that the population dynamics of ungulates in predator-free environments is strongly influenced by a combination of stochastic variation in the environment, and population density. Both density dependence and environmental stochasticity operate through changes. In life history traits, correlated with variation in body weight. This generates delays in the response of the population to changes in environment. In the absence of predation, a stable equilibrium is therefore unlikely to exist between an ungulate population and its food resources. This thorough understanding of the mechanisms generating population fluctuations suggests that studies of ungulates will provide an important source for examining effects of long-term changes in the environment, for instance, resulting from a climatic change.},

abstract = {Habitat selection is a fundamental behaviour that links individuals to the resources required for survival and reproduction. Although natural selection acts on an individual's phenotype, research on habitat selection often pools inter-individual patterns to provide inferences on the population scale. Here, we expanded a traditional approach of quantifying habitat selection at the individual level to explore the potential for consistent individual differences of habitat selection. We used random coefficients in resource selection functions (RSFs) and repeatability estimates to test for variability in habitat selection. We applied our method to a detailed dataset of GPS relocations of brown bears (Ursus arctos) taken over a period of 6 years, and assessed whether they displayed repeatable individual differences in habitat selection toward two habitat types: bogs and recent timber-harvest cut blocks. In our analyses, we controlled for the availability of habitat, i.e. the functional response in habitat selection. Repeatability estimates of habitat selection toward bogs and cut blocks were 0.304 and 0.420, respectively. Therefore, 30.4 and 42.0 {\%} of the population-scale habitat selection variability for bogs and cut blocks, respectively, was due to differences among individuals, suggesting that consistent individual variation in habitat selection exists in brown bears. Using simulations, we posit that repeatability values of habitat selection are not related to the value and significance of $\beta$ estimates in RSFs. Although individual differences in habitat selection could be the results of non-exclusive factors, our results illustrate the evolutionary potential of habitat selection.},

A swallow's breeding latitude influenced timing of breeding, which then carried over to affect breeding ground departure. This resulted in subsequent effects on the arrival and departure schedules at autumn stopover locations and timing of arrival at non-breeding locations. This 'domino effect' between timing events was no longer apparent by the time individuals departed for spring migration.

abstract = {The study took place between July and September 2008 with the main objective to develop a first local environmental assessment suitable to obtain a general description of the agro-system environment of five villages in the Southern Region of Malawi. The research has been carried out in an administrative sub-division of the peri-urban area of the city of Blantyre, called Ntonda EPA (Extension Planning Area), where target villages had been previously identified for the overexploitation of their natural resource base and the mismanagement of their soils. This study attempts to illustrate the agro-ecosystem of the five villages in the area, their main features and the main anthropic factors, viewed as causes that could lead to desertification. As the matter of fact, the overexploitation of soils, which can be fairly considered as the one and only resource base endowment available in the area. The current farming system, heavily reliant on mere subsistence, is strictly interlinked with unsustainable fertilisation methods and a prevalent lack of socio-economic activities. Poorly planned and managed cropping systems yield low and erratic productions, despite government subsidized chemical fertilisation programmes; post-harvest management and storage are nearly inexistent and so are agricultural commodity exchanges with otherwise fairly accessible urban areas. As a result, agricultural investment (including on soil conservation) is minimal and local areas remain vulnerable to land degradation and ultimately to desertification. The baseline data collected with this research provide information on the main issues that determine the process of land degradation and desertification in the area. The study is based on the analysis of climate and soil parameters. This paper attempts to provide: - a first assessment of vulnerability to desertification at local level, specifically at village level in the Southern Region of Malawi; - an identification of the major causes and trends of agro-system degradation; - a set of recommendations as to how to avoid further degradation of the agro-system before the desertification process becomes irreversible and untreatable.},

abstract = {Population genetics approaches are becoming widely used to assess the propagation potential of wildlife diseases. Such studies are often conducted on uninfected hosts because acute zoonotic diseases pose significant health risks to humans and infected hosts are thus more difficult to obtain. Predictions of disease spread potential assume that infected and uninfected individuals exhibit similar movement behaviours and genotypes. However, some diseases, such as rabies, might enhance individual's dispersal behaviour. Thus, if rabid animals are mostly long-distance migrants, prediction of rabies spread potential based on genetic analyses of uninfected animals might be misleading. Here, we genotyped 84 rabid and 113 nonrabid raccoons (Procyon lotor) to assess whether a difference in genetic structure pattern could be detected between these groups in a rabies epizootic area in southern Quebec, Canada. We also assessed whether genetic diversity differs among rabid and nonrabid raccoons by comparing expected heterozygosity, allelic richness, and inbreeding coefficient of the 2 groups. Finally, we tested for possible associations between rabies infection and microsatellite genotypes. We found no evidence of genetic structuring and no difference in genetic diversity among nonrabid and rabid raccoons. We also have limited evidence for a link between genotype and infection status. Our results thus suggest that the genetic structure of nonrabid raccoons is representative of that found in infected individuals and is thus effective to infer rabies propagation patterns in the wild.},

Irrespective of both population density and sex, habitat quality did not influence survivorship of prime-age or senescent roe deer. Likewise, habitat quality did not influence fawn survival at low density. On the other hand, fawn survival at high density was 20{\%} higher in the resource-rich hornbeam-dominant coppices than in the other poorer habitats. We found, as expected, that fawns were mobile, whereas adults of both sexes were highly sedentary. Movements of roe deer among habitats were markedly influenced by habitat quality. Transition probabilities of individuals from the rich hornbeam coppices toward other habitats were lower than transition probabilities of individuals from the poor beech stand or from the medium-quality maple dominant coppices toward the rich hornbeam coppices.},

abstract = {Assessing the genetic variation and distribution of immune genes across heterogeneous environmental conditions in wild species is essential to further our understanding of the role of pathogen pressure and potential resistance or prevalence in hosts. Researchers have recently investigated ?-defensin genes in the wild, because their variability suggests that they may play an important role in innate host defense. This study investigated the variation occurring at 6 innate immune genes of the ?-defensin family in a declining population of tree swallows (Tachycineta bicolor) in southern Qu{\'{e}}bec, Canada (N = 160). We found that all 6 genes showed synonymous and nonsynonymous single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) within the exon coding for the mature peptide. These results indicated that this group of genes was diverse in tree swallows. Our results suggested a potential interaction of this group of genes with fluctuating pathogen diversity, however, we found no sign of positive or negative selection. We assessed whether or not the distribution of genetic diversity of ?-defensin genes in our study population differed between 2 regions that strongly differ in their level of agricultural intensification. Adults are highly philopatric to their breeding sites and their immunological responses differ between these 2 regions. However, we found little evidence that the level and distribution of genetic variability differed between these heterogeneous environmental conditions. Further studies should aim to assess the link between genetic diversity of ?-defensin genes and fitness-related traits in wild populations.},

abstract = {Non-consumptive effects of predation can strongly impact reproduction and demography of prey species. Still, the underlying mechanisms that drive non-consumptive effects are not fully understood, and the circumstances under which chronic physiological stress may mediate these effects remain unclear. Benefiting from over 23 years of environmental, physiological and demographic data, we tested the hypothesis that predation risk may impair reproduction of mountain goats through chroDnic elevation of physiological stress. We conducted path analyses to assess the relationships between predation risk, faecal glucocorticoid metabolites and hair cortisol concentration, and reproduction, while taking into account the potential effects of age class, sex, body mass, season and within individual variation in glucocorticoid concentration. Predation risk had a direct positive effect on the average annual faecal glucocorticoid concentration in the population, which, in turn, negatively affected the proportion of reproductive females. The same pattern was observed with hair cortisol concentration, but these results were inconclusive potentially due to methodological challenges in estimating annual average of hair cortisol at the population level. Our study presents one of the first robust evidence that stress-mediated breeding suppression can occur in a wild ungulate following increased predation risk, thereby providing a major insight on the mechanisms underlying non-consumptive effects of predation in wild mammals.

abstract = {Unravelling the genetic basis of phenotypic variation among individuals is an important step in our understanding of evolution. Recent studies of innate immune genes, such as $\beta$-defensins, revealed that these genes had high levels of polymorphism. However, researchers have yet to quantify the effects of such variability on immune responses and fitness-related traits in wild populations. In this study, we assessed how the variability at six avian $\beta$-defensin (AvBD) genes was linked to an immune function and reproductive success in adult tree swallows (Tachycineta bicolor). We investigated the links between genetic variations using single nucleotide polymorphisms at AvBD genes, immune function as the bacterial killing ability (BKA) and fledging success. We assessed how female immunogenetics were linked to the presence of eggshell bacteria in their clutches and hatching success. We found weak associations between the presence of AvBD genes, BKA and eggshell bacteria. Our results suggested that homozygosity at some loci may be advantageous for defence against bacteria. Variability at $\beta$-defensin genes was not related to either hatching or fledging success. BKA of parents was positively linked with fledging success. More studies are needed to assess whether or not $\beta$-defensin genes are significantly affecting fitness-related traits in wild populations.},

The removal of key individuals, such as matriarchs or dominant males, can disrupt social structure and exacerbate the impact of hunting on population growth. We do not know, however, how and when the spatiotemporal reorganization takes place after removal and if such changes can be the mechanism that explain a decrease in population growth. Detailed behavioral information from individually monitored brown bears, in a population where hunting increases sexually selected infanticide, revealed that adult males increased their use of home ranges of hunter-killed neighbors in the second year after their death. Use of a hunter-killed male's home range was influenced by the survivor's as well as the hunter-killed male's age, population density, and hunting intensity. Our results emphasize that hunting can have long-term indirect effects which can affect population viability.},

Unbiased data are required to detect true changes in phenotypic distribution or population size. Because of the difficulty of collecting detailed individual data from wild populations, data from hunting records are often used. Hunting records, however, may not represent a random sample of a population. We aimed to detect and quantify potential bias in hunting records. We compared data from a long-term monitoring project with hunting records of brown bears (Ursus arctos) in Sweden and investigated temporal trends (1996-2013) in the ratio of yearlings to adult females, yearling mass and adult female mass. Data from hunting records underestimated the decline in yearling and adult female mass over time, most likely owing to the legal protection of family groups from hunting, but reflected changes in the ratio of yearlings to adult females more reliably. Although hunting data can be reliable to approximate population abundance in some circumstances, hunting data can represent a biased sample of a population and should be used with caution in management and conservation decisions.},

abstract = {Dynamics of herbivore populations can be influenced both by density-dependent processes and climate. We used age-at-harvest data for adult female white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) collected over 23 years to estimate survival and reproduction by age class and to identify effects of environmental factors. The study population was located on Anticosti Island (QC, Canada), at the northern limit of the species' range; the population was at high density, and the landscape had scarce forage and abundant snow during winter. Despite severe environmental conditions, population growth apparently increased during the study; adult survival was similar to other populations, although reproduction appeared lower. Winter severity was not related to survival, but density affected adult female survival. Density at estrus was the main factor influencing reproduction of 2- and 3–4-year-olds and also affected reproduction of prime-aged females (5–9-yr-olds), but not of older females. Reproductive rate of younger females was influenced by environmental conditions in autumn, such as high density or snow conditions that limited forage availability. Reproductive success of 5–9- and ≥10-year-old females appeared dependent on spring conditions favoring high-quality forage, probably through effects on neonatal survival. Relative to other studies on northern ungulates, demographic processes in our study appeared to be more affected by autumn and spring climate, in addition to population density, than by winter climate. We thus propose that population density, as well as autumn and spring climate, should be considered in management strategies. Harvest data offered a unique opportunity to study forest ungulates, for which individual monitoring is rarely possible.},

While the negative effects of parasitism on hosts are well documented, these can also be amplified by interactions with environmental stressors, many of which are anthropogenic. Yet, we know little about the possible effects of anthropogenic perturbations on parasite prevalence. The goals of this study were to assess the prevalence and environmental determinants of haemosporidian parasites in a declining population of Tree swallows ( Tachycineta bicolor ) living in an agricultural landscape in southern Qu{\'{e}}bec, Canada. Overall, a low prevalence and a moderate lineage diversity were identified in both adults and nestlings, confirming that transmission can occur during the breeding period. Anthropic areas, extensive cultures (hayfields and pastures) and forest cover within 500 km of nest boxes, as well as daily temperature fluctuations, were all related to infection by haemosporidian parasites. These findings suggest that anthropogenic alterations of landscape composition can modulate the prevalence of haemosporidian parasites in Tree swallows. Our results represent a baseline for future comparative studies assessing haemosporidian parasite prevalence in human-modified landscapes.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature. Abstract: Climate change can lead to a mismatch between resource availability and key life history events. Without plasticity in reproductive traits, that mismatch can lower fitness and decrease population size. In birds, phenotypic plasticity is frequently reported as the main mechanism to track environmental changes, but evidence for plasticity in large mammals is scarce. Using long-term individual-based data, we quantified phenotypic plasticity in 394 parturition dates of 137 bighorn sheep ewes (average 2.9 per ewe, range 1–11 parturition dates) in response to environmental drivers. Over 26 years, we detected a population response to environmental drivers, as median parturition date advanced by 15 days. Our study area showed temporal trends in population density, precipitation in October–November and temperature in August–November. Increasing autumn precipitation was associated with later parturition. Increasing autumn temperature was associated with earlier parturition but the effect was weak. Analyses of the between- and within-individual components of weather, climate and density revealed an individual adjustment to autumn precipitation. We detected no plasticity in response to variation in temperature and density and no variation in plasticity (no I × E) in response to any determinants of parturition date. Our results suggest that the reproductive phenology of species with long and fixed gestation may respond more to environmental drivers in autumn than in spring. Significance statement: Many organisms time reproductive events based on seasonal availability of food resources. Climate change, however, can affect the timing of food availability. Organisms can change the timing of reproduction over the short term through phenotypic plasticity. Little is known, however, about how much individual plasticity in reproductive timing exists in wild mammals. We examined phenotypic plasticity in parturition date in bighorn sheep in response to changes in autumn precipitation, autumn temperature, a global climate index and adult female density. Temporal trends in these variables over 26 years partly explained a 15-day advance in average parturition date. Individual ewes only appeared to show plasticity in response to autumn precipitation, suggesting some capacity to cope with rapid global environmental changes over the short term.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2019 American Ornithological Society. All rights reserved. There have been an increasing number of observations of itinerancy in migratory songbirds, where individuals move among 2 or more widely separated areas during the "stationary" nonbreeding season. Knowledge of such movements and an understanding of what drives them are important for predicting how migratory populations will respond to environmental change. In this study, we investigated nonbreeding movements of the Tree Swallow (Tachycineta bicolor), an aerial insectivore that breeds across North America and spends the nonbreeding season around the Gulf of Mexico, Florida, Mexico, Central America, and the Caribbean. With year-round tracking data obtained from 133 light-level geolocators deployed at 12 breeding sites ranging from Alaska to Nova Scotia to North Carolina, we show that 44{\%} of individuals made at least one large-scale movement (range: 301-1,744 km) within the nonbreeding range. The frequency of itinerancy decreased with longitude, such that 75{\%} of individuals made a movement in the western portion of the nonbreeding range compared to only 31{\%} in the east. Using the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) as a proxy for resource availability, we found that when individuals did move, they were more likely to move from sites where resources were deteriorating faster (a more negative change in NDVI prior to departure) than their destination sites. There was also evidence that individuals moved to destination sites with higher NDVI and temperature in the autumn, but not in the winter. Our results suggest movements of Tree Swallows during the nonbreeding season are influenced by resource availability, but because not all individuals used multiple nonbreeding sites, the density of individuals at a site and the level of competition may have also been a factor influencing nonbreeding season movements.},

Testosterone level could affect competition for mates and thus be a target of sexual selection. We sought to relate testosterone levels to male mating competitiveness, by teasing apart the relationships between testosterone, behavior, and growth before the mating period. We monitored 24 adult bighorn rams (Ovis canadensis) at Ram Mountain, Alberta, from 2008 to 2011. Using linear mixed models, we tested the relationships between testosterone metabolites in feces, social rank, and both growth and size of two sexually selected traits: horns and body mass. The correlation between testosterone and social rank varied with age. Testosterone and rank were weakly and negatively correlated for young rams, positively correlated for prime-aged rams, and negatively correlated for older rams. Although testosterone had an increasingly positive effect on total horn length until 8 years of age, we could not detect any effects on annual growth rate of horns or body mass. Testosterone may be related to male's ability to compete for mates through its relationship with behaviors determining social rank, rather than by influencing the development of morphological traits. Differences in testosterone levels among competitors may be a proximate cause of variance in fitness. {\textcopyright} 2013 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

abstract = {Sexual selection has a critical role in evolution, and it is fundamental to identify what ecological factors drive its variation. Disentangling the ecological correlates of sexual selection over the long term, however, is challenging and has rarely been done in nature. We sought to assess how demographic changes influenced the intensity, direction and form of sexual selection and whether selective pressures varied with age. We tested whether breeder sex ratio, number of competitors and age structure influenced selection differentials on horn length of wild bighorn rams (Ovis canadensis) of different age classes on Ram Mountain, Alberta. We used 21 years of data including a detailed pedigree, demographic parameters and repeated morphological measurements. Sexual selection on horn length of males of all ages was directional and positive. Selection intensity increased with the number of competitors, reflecting male-male encounter rate during the rut, but was independent of breeder sex ratio or age structure. This result can also be linked to changes in population size because the number of competitors was highly correlated to total number of sheep. This demographic effect likely arises from age-dependent mating tactics. Males aged 2-4 years are weakly competitive and experienced stronger sexual selection as they accounted for a greater proportion of all males. Selection experienced by mature males appeared independent of demography. Our study provides a rare description of the demographic determinants of sexual selection in nature.},

abstract = {Life-history theory predicts that selection could favor the decoupling of somatic and reproductive senescence if post-reproductive lifespan (PRLS) provides additional indirect fitness benefits [1, 2]. The grandmother hypothesis proposes that prolonged PRLS evolved because post-reproductive grandmothers gain inclusive fitness benefits by helping their daughters and grandchildren [3, 4]. Because most historical human data do not report direct evidence of help, we hypothesized that geographic distance between individuals may be inversely related to their capacity to help. Using an exceptionally detailed dataset of pre-industrial French settlers in the St. Lawrence Valley during the 17 th and 18 th centuries, we assessed the potential for grandmothers to improve their inclusive fitness by helping their descendants, and we evaluated how this effect varied with geographic distance, ranging between 0 and 325 km, while accounting for potential familial genetic and environmental effects [5–9]. Grandmothers (F0) who were alive allowed their daughters (F1) to increase their number of offspring (F2) born by 2.1 and to increase their number of offspring surviving to 15 years of age by 1.1 compared to when grandmothers were dead. However, the age at first reproduction was not influenced by the life status (alive or dead) of grandmothers. As geographic distance increased, the number of offspring born and lifetime reproductive success decreased, while the age at first reproduction increased, despite the grandmother being alive in these analyses. Our study suggests that geographic proximity has the potential to modulate inclusive fitness, supporting the grandmother hypothesis, and to contribute to our understanding of the evolution of PRLS. Engelhardt et al. show that the indirect fitness benefits accrued by grandmothers, after accounting for potential familial genetic and environmental effects, supports the proposition that the grandmother hypothesis can, in part, explain post-reproductive lifespan. Geographic proximity potentially modulates the inclusive fitness benefits.},

abstract = {Spatio-temporal variations in conspecific density and resource availability are two of the main factors responsible for plasticity in habitat selection. Despite the need for habitat selection models that can accurately predict animal distribution given the plasticity in the selection process, no study has assessed the synergistic effects of these factors on habitat selection. We investigated density-dependent functional responses by raccoons (Procyon lotor) and striped skunks (Mephitis mephitis), two of the main hosts of the rabies virus in North America. We monitored 54 raccoons and 12 striped skunks with Global-Positioning- System collars in a landscape dominated by corn fields and forest patches. We built resource selection functions to evaluate if the selection of corn fields varied with conspecific density and corn field availability within 100{\%} minimum convex polygons. Raccoons altered their selection of corn fields depending on both conspecific density and corn-forest edge density or corn field proportion. In areas of low corn-forest edge densities and a low corn field proportion, raccoons showed stronger selection for corn fields when few conspecifics were present. At high conspecific densities, the selection of corn fields was stronger in areas with high corn-forest edge densities and a low corn field proportion. For striped skunks, we did not detect any synergistic effect of density-dependence and functional responses. Unlike raccoons, striped skunks displayed a selection that was strongest for agricultural corridors. We show that functional responses in habitat selection can be density-dependent. In a context of infectious disease dynamics, modeling densitydependence in functional responses increases the ability to predict spatio-temporal variations in the distribution of reservoir species and thus, to delineate areas at high animal densities where the risk of disease outbreaks is relatively high. For example, the omission of density-dependence in functional responses underestimated the relative probability of raccoon occurrence in corn fields, while overestimating the relative probability of occurrence in anthropogenic areas and wetlands. Our study underscores the relevance of considering the complexity of habitat selection by all hosts of a zoonosis. Costeffective control and prevention programs used to limit disease spread can benefit from accounting for density-dependent functional responses of a multi-host disease system.},

abstract = {Environmental conditions experienced during early growth and development markedly shape phenotypic traits. Consequently, individuals of the same cohort may show similar life-history tactics throughout life. Conditions experienced later in life, however, could fine-tune these initial differences, either increasing (cumulative effect) or decreasing (compensatory effect) the magnitude of cohort variation with increasing age. Our novel comparative analysis that quantifies cohort variation in individual body size trajectories shows that initial cohort variation dissipates throughout life, and that lifetime patterns change both across species with different paces of life and between sexes. We used longitudinal data on body size (mostly assessed using mass) from 11 populations of large herbivores spread along the "slow-fast" continuum of life histories. We first quantified cohort variation using mixture models to identify clusters of cohorts with similar initial size. We identified clear cohort clusters in all species except the one with the slowest pace of life, revealing that variation in early size is structured among cohorts and highlighting typological differences among cohorts. Growth trajectories differed among cohort clusters, highlighting how early size is a fundamental determinant of lifetime growth patterns. In all species, among-cohort variation in size peaked at the start of life, then quickly decreased with age and stabilized around mid-life. Cohort variation was lower in species with a slower than a faster pace of life, and vanished at prime age in species with the slowest pace of life. After accounting for viability selection, compensatory/catch-up growth in early life explained much of the decrease in cohort variation. Females showed less phenotypic variability and stronger compensatory/catch-up growth than males early in life, whereas males showed more progressive changes throughout life. These results confirm that stronger selective pressures for rapid growth make males more vulnerable to poor environmental conditions early in life and less able to recover after a poor start. Our comparative analysis illustrates how variability in growth changes over time in closely related species that span a wide range on the slow-fast continuum, the main axis of variation in life-history strategies of vertebrates.},

abstract = {Trophy hunting, the selective removal of animals for human recreation, can contribute to conservation when appropriately managed. Yet, little is known about how harvest rates or different definitions of trophy affect age structure and trophy size in harvested animals and in survivors because no controlled studies exist. To investigate the impacts of different management regimes, we developed an individual-based model for bighorn sheep (Ovis canadensis), based on empirical data on survival from a protected population and data on horn growth from 2 populations that differed in their growth rates. One population showed slow horn growth and the other population fast horn growth. We subjected these model populations to varying harvest rates and 2 different hunting regulations: 4/5 curl and full-curl definitions of a trophy male. We found that the effect of hunting regulations depends on horn growth rate. In populations with fast horn growth, the effects of trophy hunting on male age structure and horn size were greater and the effect of a change in the definition of legal male smaller than in populations with slow growth rates. High harvest rates led to a younger age structure and smaller horn size. Both effects were weakened by a more restrictive definition of trophy male. As harvest rates increased past 40{\%} of legal males, the number of males harvested increased only marginally because an increasing proportion of the harvested males included those that had just become legal. Although our simulation focused on bighorn sheep, the link between horn growth rate and harvest effects may be applicable for any size-selective harvest regime. {\textcopyright} 2017 The Wildlife Society.},

abstract = {Background: Evolutionary changes in natural populations can occur on ecological time scales. Investigators have become very interested in characterizing short-term fluctuations in selection pressure, in identifying the circumstances under which the opportunity for selection is greatest, and in determining whether this opportunity is realized. Aims: Introduce a new metric to explore how the opportunity for selection on the mean of a phenotypic character varies with time. Using data from two long-term studies of marked individuals, examine how the opportunity for and the selection on a character mean and variance covary with population growth. Metrics: The traditional opportunity for selection metric (OS) is defined as the variance in relative fitness or the variation in absolute fitness divided by the square of the mean absolute fitness. This metric might not be appropriate to evaluate the maximum selection acting on a quantitative character because individual variation in both quantitative characters and in fitness underpins evolution by natural selection. We therefore develop a new metric, the opportunity for selection on a quantitative character (OSM), which considers variation in both character and fitness distributions. Methods: Determine selection, OS, and OSM, in both simulated and empirical data. Compare the results for the traditional OS metric with the new OSM. Results: The classical measure of the OS correlates with the OSM when calculated on simulated data but their association was curvilinear for non-normally distributed fitness components. Similar results were found for empirical data but their correlations were lower. Selection is strongest in declining populations and is greatest when the OSM is large, as in harsh environments. Conclusions: Because most fitness components are non-normally distributed, OS will only approximately capture the maximum possible selection differential on phenotypic characters over a time step. The OSM should be a more useful metric for determining how selection will alter the distribution of characters. {\textcopyright} 2012 Fanie Pelletier.},

abstract = {Because parasite resistance and reproduction require metabolic resources, life-history models predict a tradeoff between current reproduction and parasite load. These tradeoffs have been widely studied in birds, but few studies have been conducted on mammals. We monitored lungworm (Protostrongylus spp.) larvae counts in bighorn sheep (Ovis canadensis) over four years to examine how individual differences in fecal output of lungworm larvae (LPG) by yearlings and adults were affected by season, sex, body mass, age and reproductive effort. We also compared lamb mass at six months and LPG. Overall, we found that LPG varies seasonally, peaking in females prior to lambing and in males during the rut. Age had no effect on LPG for either sex. During autumn, we found no effect of age or mass on LPG for sheep one year and older. Lamb body size or sex did not affect LPG. Females that weaned a lamb had higher counts than females that did not produce a lamb or females whose lamb died during summer. For rams, social rank and testosterone levels were not related to LPG but LPG increased with time spent searching for estrous ewes during the rut. Our results suggest a tradeoff between parasite resistance and reproductive effort in bighorn sheep of both sexes. Copyright {\textcopyright} Oikos 2005.},

abstract = {The recent trend for journals to require open access to primary data included in publications has been embraced by many biologists, but has caused apprehension amongst researchers engaged in long-term ecological and evolutionary studies. A worldwide survey of 73 principal investigators (Pls) with long-term studies revealed positive attitudes towards sharing data with the agreement or involvement of the PI, and 93{\%} of PIs have historically shared data. Only 8{\%} were in favor of uncontrolled, open access to primary data while 63{\%} expressed serious concern. We present here their viewpoint on an issue that can have non-trivial scientific consequences. We discuss potential costs of public data archiving and provide possible solutions to meet the needs of journals and researchers. Public data archiving is the archiving of primary data used in publications so that they can be preserved and made accessible to all online. Public data archiving is increasingly required by journals. However, the costs of public data archiving might be underestimated, in particular with respect to long-term studies. Long-term studies have been responsible for the answers to many important questions in evolution and ecology which could only be answered through following the life-histories of individuals for decades. Several papers have been published in favor of public data archiving, but a more balanced viewpoint is necessary to allow a discussion to emerge on a code of ethics and ways to preserve and protect the data, encourage the initiation and continuation of long-term studies, and meet the requirements of the whole scientific community.},

abstract = {More extreme climatic events (ECEs) are among the most prominent consequences of climate change. Despite a long-standing recognition of the importance of ECEs by paleo-ecologists and macro-evolutionary biologists, ECEs have only recently received a strong interest in the wider ecological and evolutionary community. However, as with many rapidly expanding fields, it lacks structure and cohesiveness, which strongly limits scientific progress. Furthermore, due to the descriptive and anecdotal nature of many ECE studies it is still unclear what the most relevant questions and long-term consequences are of ECEs. To improve synthesis, we first discuss ways to define ECEs that facilitate comparison among studies. We then argue that biologists should adhere to more rigorous attribution and mechanistic methods to assess ECE impacts. Subsequently, we discuss conceptual and methodological links with climatology and disturbance-, tipping point- and paleo-ecology. These research fields have close linkages with ECE research, but differ in the identity and/or the relative severity of environmental factors. By summarizing the contributions to this theme issue we draw parallels between behavioural, ecological and evolutionary ECE studies, and suggest that an overarching challenge is that most empirical and theoretical evidence points towards responses being highly idiosyncratic, and thus predictability being low. Finally, we suggest a roadmap based on the proposition that an increased focus on the mechanisms behind the biological response function will be crucial for increased understanding and predictability of the impacts of ECE.},

Fecal samples were collected from marked males during the pre-rut and the rut over 2 years. Results were highly repeatable for samples of the same ram within a day (r = 0.93). Fecal testosterone peaked during the pre-rut (when social relationships are established) and then declined from the pre-rut to the rut.

When age was accounted for, however, the relationship between social rank and testosterone was no longer significant.

There was no association between aggressiveness and social rank (r = 0.13, P = 0.591). To our knowledge, this is the first report of an association between testosterone levels and individual social rank in wild ungulates.},

Guarding males are thought to forage less during the rut than do nonguarding males, possibly leading to greater fitness costs. I observed bighorn rams foraging during the pre-rut and the rut. I compared how coursing (an alternative mating tactic) and tending (a form of mate guarding) affected the foraging behavior of bighorn rams over the rut, to test whether foraging was more constrained by mate guarding than by coursing. All adult males spent less time feeding during the rut compared with the pre-rut. The decrease in time spent feeding, however, was independent of mating tactic. Contrary to expectation, individual rams observed both coursing and tending spent less time foraging when coursing than when tending. For young rams, the time spent in rutting activities was correlated with individual pre-rut mass, indicating that males either modify their behavior according to available metabolic reserves or adjust the energy devoted to rutting activities to the level of expected benefits. Mate guarding does not appear to constrain foraging more than coursing. The costs of male reproductive behavior may depend more upon individual effort than on the particular tactic adopted.},

abstract = {Heterogeneity among individuals influences the life-history trajectories we observe at the population level because viability selection, selective immigration and emigration processes, and ontogeny change the proportion of individuals with specific trait values with increasing age. Here, we review the two main approaches that have been proposed to account for these processes in life-history trajectories, contrasting how they quantify ontogeny and selection, and proposing ways to overcome some of their limitations. Nearly all existing approaches to model individual heterogeneity assume either a single normal distribution or a priori known groups of individuals. Ontogenetic processes, however, can vary across individuals through variation in life-history tactics. We show the usefulness of describing ontogenetic processes by modelling trajectories with a mixture model that focuses on heterogeneity in life-history tactics. Additionally, most methods examine individual heterogeneity in a single trait, ignoring potential correlations among multiple traits caused by latent common sources of individual heterogeneity. We illustrate the value of using a joint modelling approach to assess the presence of a shared latent correlation and its influence on life-history trajectories. We contrast the strengths and limitations of different methods for different research questions, and we exemplify the differences among methods using empirical data from long-term studies of ungulates.},

However, the relative importance of social behavior for fitness, compared to morphology and environment, remains largely unknown. We assessed the importance of sociality for fitness (lamb production and survival) in a population of marked bighorn sheep (Ovis canadensis) over 16 years (n = 1022 sheep-years). We constructed social networks from observations (n = 38 350) of group membership (n = 3150 groups). We then tested whether consistent individual differences in social behavior (centrality) exist and evaluated their relative importance compared to factors known to affect fitness: mass, age, parental effects, and population density. Sheep exhibited consistent individual differences in social centrality. Controlling for maternal carryover effects and age, the positive effect of centrality in a social network on adult female lamb production and survival was equal or greater than the effect of body mass or population density. Social centrality had less effect on male survival and no effect on adult male lamb production or lamb survival. Through its effect on lamb production and survival, sociality in fission-fusion animal societies may ultimately influence population dynamics equally or more than morphological or environmental effects.},

It presents a rationale for why one would expect a feedback between behaviour and population dynamics, and suggests hypotheses as to what behaviours are more likely to affect population growth. It briefly reviews research that explores the classic links between population-level processes and behaviour, and how population dynamics can affect individual behaviour. It highlights empirical studies that support the recent suggestion of a reverse link between population and behaviour, and provides examples of study systems where researchers have documented the complete feedback loop. It also emphasizes instances where humans have affected the interaction between these processes.},

abstract = {When phenotypic change occurs over time in wildlife populations, it can be difficult to determine to what degree it is because of genetic effects or phenotypic plasticity. Here, we assess phenotypic changes over time in horn length and volume of thinhorn sheep (. Ovis dalli) rams from Yukon Territory, Canada. We considered 42 years of horn growth from over 50 000 growth measurements in over 8000 individuals. We found that weather explained a large proportion of the annual fluctuation in horn growth, being particularly sensitive to spring weather. Only 2.5{\%} of variance in horn length growth could be explained by an individual effect, and thus any genetic changes over the time period could only have had a small effect on phenotypes. Our findings allow insight into the capacity for horn morphology to react to selection pressures and demonstrate the overall importance of climate in determining growth. {\textcopyright} 2010 The Authors.

abstract = {There is large interspecific variation in the magnitude of population fluctuations, even among closely related species. The factors generating this variation are not well understood, primarily because of the challenges of separating the relative impact of variation in population size from fluctuations in the environment. Here, we show using demographic data from 13 bird populations that magnitudes of fluctuations in population size are mainly driven by stochastic fluctuations in the environment. Regulation towards an equilibrium population size occurs through density-dependent mortality. At small population sizes, population dynamics are primarily driven by environment-driven variation in recruitment, whereas close to the carrying capacity K, variation in population growth is more strongly influenced by density-dependent mortality of both juveniles and adults. Our results provide evidence for the hypothesis proposed by Lack that population fluctuations in birds arise from temporal variation in the difference between density-independent recruitment and density-dependent mortality during the non-breeding season.},

abstract = {Immunity represents an important defense mechanism against pathogens and is intimately linked to fitness. Previous studies have found significant interindividual variation of immune responses in wild populations and have emphasized the importance of ecological factors in explaining this variability. A deterioration of environmental conditions, such as agricultural intensification, can modify resource availability and, as a result, alter immune functions. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of agricultural intensification on innate immune functions in breeding adult tree swallows (Tachycineta bicolor) over 6 yr. We investigated the relationship between agricultural intensification and bacteria-killing ability (BKA) against a strain of E. coli. We also assessed how the presence and the number of bacteria on the surface of eggshells changed with agricultural intensification. Contrary to our expectations, we found a positive relationship between agricultural intensification and BKA, where individuals had higher BKA in intensive compared to nonintensive farmlands. While this trend was observed through the 6-yr study, we also found a tendency for a reduction of BKA over time. We found no relationships between the presence or number of different types of eggshell bacteria and agricultural intensification or an association between BKA of females and eggshell bacteria of their clutch. Our results suggest that differences in immune function observed between intensive and nonintensive farmlands could reflect genetic differences among individuals and/or trade-offs with other traits expressed among habitats within our study system.},

abstract = {Several empirical studies have shown that variation in daily energy expenditure (DEE) and resting metabolic rate (RMR) is influenced by environmental and individual factors, but whether these shared influences are responsible for, or independent of, relationships between DEE and RMR remains unknown. The objectives of this study were to (i) simultaneously evaluate the effects of environmental and individual variables on DEE and RMR in free-ranging eastern chipmunks (Tamias striatus) and (ii) quantify the correlation between DEE and RMR before and after controlling for common sources of variation. We found that the influence of individual factors on DEE and RMR is most often shared, whereas the influence of environmental factors tends to be distinct. Both raw and mass-adjusted DEE and RMR were significantly correlated, but this correlation vanished after accounting for the shared effect of reproduction on both traits. However, within reproductive individuals, DEE and RMR remained positively correlated after accounting for all other significant covariates. The ratio of DEE to RMR was significantly higher during reproduction than at other times of the year and was negatively correlated with ambient temperature. DEE and RMR appear to be inherently correlated during reproduction, but this correlation does not persist during other, less energy-demanding periods of the annual cycle. {\textcopyright} 2013.

abstract = {In polygynous ungulates, the rut imposes constraints on male time budgets that generate a trade-off between maintenance and reproduction, leading to a reduction in time spent foraging. As mating activities can incur substantial somatic costs, males are expected to spend their 'non-rutting' time recovering during the breeding season. If the diminution in time allocated to foraging by males is only a consequence of time budget constraints, males should keep a similar ratio of time spent foraging to lying to that observed in the pre-rut, leading to an overall reduction of these two activities (the 'foraging constraint' hypothesis). Alternatively, if males adopt an energy-saving strategy, they should limit energy expenditures by reducing foraging but not lying time, as the energy gains of forage intake may not meet the basal energetic requirements, especially in northern and temperate regions (the 'energy-saving' hypothesis). Here, we contrast these two hypotheses by comparing individual daily time budgets of marked adult bighorn sheep rams (Ovis canadensis) and male mountain goats (Oreamnos americanus) during the pre-rut and the rut. Concordant results for both species support the 'foraging constraint' hypothesis, as sexually-active males reduced time spent foraging and lying from the pre-rut to the rut because of an increase in time spent in mating-related activities. Bighorn sheep rams also increased time spent foraging when not engaged in mating tactics, providing further support for a 'maximisation' of energy intake in the absence of reproductive opportunities. Because there are also known physiological changes that occur during the rut which may cause appetite suppression, for example to produce metabolic compounds linked with olfactory communication (the 'scent-urination' hypothesis) or to cope with increased burden of parasites (the 'parasite-induced anorexia' hypothesis), further research should aim at simultaneously testing these current hypotheses to better understand rut-induced hypophagia and its effects on the life histories of male ungulates. {\textcopyright} 2009 The Authors.},

abstract = {Matrix population models are tools for elucidating the association between demographic processes and population dynamics. A large amount of useful theory pivots on the assumption of equilibrium dynamics. The preceding transient is, however, of genuine conservation concern as it encompasses the short-term impact of natural or anthropogenic disturbance on the population. We review recent theoretical advances in deterministic transient analysis of matrix projection models, considering how disturbance can alter population dynamics by provoking a new population trajectory. We illustrate these impacts using plant and vertebrate systems across contiguous and fragmented landscapes. Short-term responses are of fundamental relevance for applied ecology, because the time-scale of transient effects is often similar to the length of many conservation projects. Investigation of the immediate, post-disturbance phase is vital for understanding how population processes respond to widespread disturbance in the short- and into the long term. Synthesis and applications. Transient analysis is critical for understanding and predicting the consequences of management activities. By considering short-term population responses to perturbations, especially in long-lived species, managers can develop more informed strategies for species harvesting or controlling of invasive species. {\textcopyright} 2010 The Authors.

A quadratsampling methodology was adopted to estimate the biomass and its carbon content of 11 different land-uses in the study area.Existing soil data were used to calculate the soil carbon. GIS was used for integrating biomass carbon, soil carbon and carbonstock mapping. Roth carbon model was used to project the soil carbon of present land-uses in the coming 10 years and based onwhich the sustainability of land-uses was predicted. The total carbon stock of agricultural land-uses was estimated to be 205 Tg,of which 4149 per cent was biomass carbon and 5851 per cent was soil carbon. Among the land-uses, para rubber had thehighest average biomass C (13634MgC ha1) while paddy had the lowest (708MgC ha1). About four-fifths of agriculturalland-uses in the watershed are sustainable in maintaining the desired level of soil carbon in coming 10 years while one-fifths areunstable.

abstract = {For many ungulates, male reproductive success increases with social rank. Because rank is established through contests, it should be correlated with individual mass and select for high sexual dimorphism in body mass. It is difficult to weigh free-ranging ungulates, however, so empirical data on the relation between mass and social rank are scarce. We monitored individual mass and social rank of marked bighorn rams, Ovis canadensis, at Sheep River, Alberta, Canada over 5 years. Each year, rams were organized in a linear hierarchy. Social rank increased with age, and rank in one year was a good predictor of rank in the next year. The stability of dyadic relationships increased with the difference in age of individuals in the dyad but decreased as rams aged. Until about 6 years of age, the positive effects of age and individual mass on social rank were indistinguishable, because rams gained mass each year. The relation between body mass and social rank strengthened with age, probably because, after the heavier rams attain their lifetime asymptotic weight, they can challenge older conspecifics. In mature bighorn rams, social rank is a major determinant of reproductive success. By providing evidence that mass is an important determinant of rank, our study supports the contention that sexual selection leads to high sexual dimorphism in this species. {\textcopyright} 2005 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

abstract = {Phenotypic plasticity in reproductive traits is of theoretical and applied interest as one avenue by which organisms might maintain an optimal annual reproductive routine in the face of cyclic and/or directional change in environmental conditions. We used long-term, individual-based data from parapatric populations of bighorn sheep (Ovis canadensis canadensis) and pronghorn (Antilocapra americana) to evaluate plasticity in breeding date, gestation duration, birth date, birth mass, and fetal growth rate in response to inter-annual (cyclic) variation in indices of maternal energy income and expense. Traits in both species responded plastically to variation in maternal energy balance. However, despite nearly identical climate and similar vegetative habitat, plasticity was expressed in fundamentally different ways in the study species. Variation in bighorn birth date was primarily due to plasticity in breeding date, whereas variation in pronghorn birth date was primarily due to variation in gestation duration. Across traits, bighorn plastic responses were more consistent with explanations that invoked periodic energy surplus as the basis for plasticity, whereas pronghorn plastic responses were more consistent with explanations that invoked periodic energy deficiency. Later birth date was associated with increased fetal growth rate in bighorn but decreased fetal growth rate in pronghorn. Finally, we detected strong directional selection for early birth among bighorn mothers but found no evidence of selection on pronghorn birth date. Collectively, our results indicate markedly different maternal tactics for timing birth. Bighorn mothers appeared to use stored energy to subsidize the cost of birth prior to the local environmental optimum in an energymediated competition with other females to minimize birth order rank. Pronghorn mothers, committed to high levels of energy allocation to offspring and subject therefore to frequent energy deficiency, timed birth conservatively to more closely match peak reproductive expenditure with peak energy income at the local environmental optimum.},

abstract = {Carbon ($\delta$13C) and nitrogen ($\delta$15N) stable isotope ratios are increasingly used in ecological studies to evaluate diet composition and trophic relationships. However, lipids may influence stable isotope ratios due to the depletion of 13C in adipose tissues relative to proteins and carbohydrates. $\delta$13C values can be corrected by lipid extraction or normalization models. The aims of our study were to evaluate the effects of lipid extraction on stable isotope ratios in a terrestrial mammal, the caribou (Rangifer tarandus caribou), and to propose relevant lipid normalization models that are method- and tissue-specific for $\delta$13C values. We also evaluated whether four $\delta$13C lipid normalization and correction models proposed in the literature were applicable to our study species. Stable isotope ratios were obtained for hair, plasma, and red blood cell samples of 44 caribou in the Gasp{\'{e}}sie National Park (Qu{\'{e}}bec, Canada). The effects of lipid extraction on stable isotope ratios were tested using a paired t-test. A simple linear model was used to correct for the effects of lipid extraction and to assess its performance compared to that of published equations. Lipid content significantly influenced $\delta$13C values in caribou hair. The four lipid normalization equations commonly used in the literature did not accurately predict $\delta$13Clipid-free values of caribou hair. Based on our results, we recommend controlling systematically for lipids in terrestrial systems and analyzing $\delta$13C (lipid-free) and $\delta$15N (bulk) from two separate aliquots to reach a greater precision. We also recommend controlling for lipids in hair tissue. If not possible, we recommend using a lipid normalization model that is tissue-, method-, and species-specific or applying a model that has been previously validated for the tissue and species of interest.},

To examine whether record books and data from male bighorn sheep (Ovis canadensis) harvested under a minimum-curl regulation could detect temporal trends in horn length, we simulated populations of trophy-harvested male bighorn sheep where horn length was modeled to increase, remain stable, and decrease over time. All populations experienced a simulated harvest based on a minimum horn length, but only horns in the longest 5{\%} of the initial distribution were entered in a fictional record book. We then assessed whether monitoring of harvested and "record" males detected temporal trends. Data from selective harvest underestimated declines and initially underestimated increases, but qualitatively detected both trends. Record-book entries, however, severely underestimated increases and did not detect declines, suggesting that they should not be used to monitor population trends.

abstract = {Although activity budgets have been studied extensively in ruminants, information on the plasticity of rumination among individuals is rare. Generally, time spent bedded is considered a proxy for time spent ruminating. Researchers rarely include measures of interindividual differences in the intensity and time spent ruminating. We explored individual variation in rumination behaviour in Rocky mountain bighorn sheep, Ovis canadensis. We expected rumination to be a plastic behaviour affected by various intrinsic and extrinsic factors such as body mass, age, sex, reproductive status and environmental conditions. We investigated rumination behaviour based on (1) mean number of chews per bolus of food (chews/bolus), (2) mean number of chews per second per bolus (chewing rate) and (3) mean time spent chewing per bolus (bolus processing time) for sheep of known age, sex, body mass and reproductive status. Our results show that both intrinsic and extrinsic factors affected rumination behaviour. Females tended to spend less time processing each bolus than males of similar body mass, resulting in a significantly higher chewing rate for females. There was no difference in chews/bolus between sexes. Environmental factors and group size also affected rumination behaviour: cold temperatures were associated with fewer chews/bolus; wind was associated with more chews/bolus. Sheep in larger groups had a slower rate of rumination than those in smaller groups. We conclude that rumination behaviour is very plastic and, therefore, that assumptions of uniform rumination rates across individuals may be misleading and may miss an important piece of ruminants' foraging ecology. {\textcopyright} 2010 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.},

abstract = {Breeding dispersal is a key process of population structure and dynamics and is often triggered by an individual's breeding failure. In both colonial and territorial birds, reproductive success of conspecifics (RSc) can also lead individuals to change breeding sites after a failure on a site. Yet, few studies have simultaneously investigated the independent contribution of individual reproductive success (RSi) and of RSc on dispersal decision. Here, we develop a modeling framework to disentangle the effects of RSi and RSc on demographic parameters, while accounting for imperfect individual detection and other confounding factors such as age or dispersal behavior in the previous year. Using a 10-year capture–recapture dataset composed of 1,595 banded tree swallows, we assessed the effects of nonmanipulated RSi and RSc on female breeding dispersal in this semicolonial passerine. Dispersal was strongly driven by RSi, but not by RSc. Unsuccessful females were 9.5–2.5 times more likely to disperse than successful ones, depending if they had dispersed or not in the previous year, respectively. Unsuccessful females were also three times less likely to be detected than successful ones. Contrary to theoretical and empirical studies, RSc did not drive the decision to disperse but influenced the selection of the following breeding site once dispersal had been initiated. Because detection of individuals was driven by RSi, which was positively correlated to RSc, assuming a perfect detection as in previous studies may have lead us to conclude that RSc affected dispersal patterns, yet our approach corrected for this bias. Overall, our results suggest that the value and use of RSc as public information to guide dispersal decisions are likely dictated by multiple ecological determinants, such as landscape structure and extent, if this cue is indeed used.},

abstract = {In many host-pathogen systems, pathogen transmission requires close contact between infectious and susceptible hosts. The contact rates among individuals depend upon how they move in the landscape because functional connectivity can affect interactions between individuals. Yet few studies have explored the interplay between contact rates, conspecific density, and functional connectivity. Using a spatially explicit individual-based model, we investigated how empirical movement rules translate into spatial patterns of contact rates among disease hosts in complex landscapes. We developed dynamic models of functional connectivity by characterizing movement behaviors of radio-collared raccoons, which are the main hosts of the raccoon rabies virus. On this basis, we simulated space-use dynamics of raccoons in virtual landscapes varying in conspecific density, forest availability, and landscape connectivity. We then characterized spatial patterns in the density of per capita contact rates of simulated raccoons. Radio-collared raccoons were more likely to choose large habitat patches that were reached by traveling along least-cost paths, and had relatively long residence times in anthropogenic areas, especially during daytime. These movement rules that were applied to simulated raccoons in virtual landscapes revealed three key patterns in contact rates. First, few simulated raccoons were responsible for most contacts between individuals, a pattern that emerged even though all simulated raccoons obeyed the same movement rules. Second, per capita contact rates increased linearly with individual density under most conditions, which indicates that raccoon rabies transmission should be density-dependent rather than frequency-dependent. Third, functional connectivity created a broad range of patterns in the density of per capita contact rates from decreasing to increasing values, depending upon the availability of land cover types. Overall, the contacts between hosts tended to occur at highest densities in forests, anthropogenic areas, and agricultural corridors. We show that complex patterns of contact rates can emerge from simple empirical movement rules and, therefore, can be key drivers of disease spread dynamics. The strong spatial heterogeneity observed in contact rates implies that the effectiveness of particular control interventions can strongly vary depending upon host density, landscape composition, and functional connectivity. This study provides key functional relationships for tailoring interventions to changes in local conditions.},

abstract = {We know little about the determinants and demographic consequences of the marked seasonal mass changes exhibited by many northern and alpine mammals. We analysed 43 years of data on individual winter mass loss (the difference between mass in early June and mass in mid-September the previous year) and summer mass gain (the difference between mass in mid-September and in early June of the same year) in adult bighorn sheep (Ovis canadensis). We calculated relative seasonal mass change as a proportion of individual body mass at the start of each season. We first examined the effects of weather and population density on relative changes in body mass. We then assessed the consequences of relative seasonal mass changes on reproduction. Mean April–May temperature was the main driver of relative seasonal mass changes: warm springs reduced both relative winter mass loss and summer mass gain of both sexes, likely partially due to a trade-off between growth rate of plants and duration of access to high-quality forage. Because these effects cancelled each other, spring temperature did not influence mass in mid-September. Mothers that lost relatively more mass during the winter had lambs that gained less mass during summer, likely because these females allocated fewer resources to lactation. Winter survival of lambs increased with their summer mass gain. In males, relative mass loss during winter, which includes the rut, did not influence the probability of siring at least one lamb, possibly indicating that greater mating effort did not necessarily translate into greater reproductive success. Our findings improve our understanding of how weather influences recruitment and underline the importance of cryptic mechanisms behind the effects of climate change on demographic traits.},

Human-induced mortality is also an important demographic factor in many populations of large mammals and may influence lifetime reproductive success. Here, we explore the effects of early development, population density, and human hunting on survival and lifetime reproductive success in brown bear (Ursus arctos) females, using a 25-year database of individually marked bears in two populations in Sweden. Survival of yearlings to 2 years was not affected by population density or body mass. Yearlings that remained with their mother had higher survival than independent yearlings, partly because regulations prohibit the harvest of bears in family groups. Although mass as a yearling did not affect juvenile survival, it was positively associated with measures of lifetime reproductive success and individual fitness. The majority of adult female brown bear mortality (72{\%}) in our study was due to human causes, mainly hunting, and many females were killed before they reproduced. Therefore, factors allowing females to survive several hunting seasons had a strong positive effect on lifetime reproductive success. We suggest that, in many hunted populations of large mammals, sport harvest is an important influence on both population dynamics and life histories. {\textcopyright} 2013 by the Ecological Society of America.},

abstract = {The study of iridescent coloration in birds emerged only recently, mainly due to the difficulty inherent in quantifying its directionality. Directionality restrains color perception to a limited angle and thereby causes drastic changes in brightness when an animal is in motion. Although a versatile goniometer for quantifying iridescent coloration has been developed recently, so far, it has only been applied to measuring the highly directional iridescent coloration in a hummingbird species. Thus, the reliability of the goniometer for species displaying more common and less directional iridescent coloration has yet to be evaluated. Additionally, two important methodological aspects remain to be assessed before this apparatus can be used confidently: 1) whether directionality, which could be subject to sexual selection, can be quantified in a repeatable way; and 2) whether the apparatus gives more precise and accurate measurements than a less complex traditional method. Using feathers collected from 271 male tree swallows Tachycineta bicolor over two years, we found that the goniometer provided repeatable measurements of directionality across individuals and across three body regions, namely the crown, mantle and rump. The apparatus was also more repeatable than a traditional method involving a bifurcated probe and reduced a brightness bias associated with individual differences in barbule tilt. We strongly encourage researchers to invest in this methodological change considering the multiple advantages demonstrated and to quantify the directionality of iridescent coloration as to unveil its role in signaling and sexual selection.

abstract = {Human-driven habitat fragmentation is increasing worldwide, and consequently many wild populations are subdivided, isolated and reduced in size. These changes in population structure reduce dispersal among subpopulations, limiting gene flow, accelerating genetic differentiation, and reducing genetic diversity and effective population sizes. Habitat fragmentation is associated with a reduced ability for populations and species to respond to changing environments, exacerbating extinction risks. The Atlantic-Gasp{\'{e}}sie population of woodland caribou (Rangifer tarandus caribou) is isolated and genetically differentiated from other populations in Canada. It has been declining dramatically during the last century and is now considered Endangered. From a management perspective, this population is considered as a single unit of {\~{}} 80 individuals, but GPS telemetry suggests that three subgroups use separate geographical areas and show limited dispersal. In this study, we used 16 microsatellite loci to (1) quantify and compare the genetic diversity observed within the three subgroups of the Atlantic-Gasp{\'{e}}sie population, (2) evaluate the extent of the spatiotemporal genetic substructure among them by assessing whether the fine-scale genetic structure differs between subgroups and if it has changed over 15 years, and (3) estimate their effective population size. We found no change in genetic diversity among/within subgroups over time. We detected genetic substructure among subgroups based on their geographical locations (Logan-Albert vs. McGerrigle) and found evidence that this substructure has increased in recent years. The effective population size of this population appears to have declined by 53{\%} over the last 15 years and is now estimated at N e = 16 individuals. Management plans and conservation actions should consider this spatial genetic substructure to prevent further decline of this endangered population.},

Here, we used landscape genetics methods to assess the genetic structure of the striped skunk (Mephitis mephitis), which is a frequent vector of rabies, a lethal zoonosis of great concern for public health. Our main objective was to identify landscape elements shaping the genetic structure of this species in Southern Qu{\'{e}}bec, Canada, in an area where the raccoon rabies variant has been detected. We hypothesised that geographic distance and landscape barriers, such as highways and major rivers, would modulate genetic structure. We genotyped a total of 289 individuals sampled across a large area (22,000 km2) at nice microsatellite loci. Genetic structure analyses identified a single genetic cluster in the study area. Major rivers and highways, however, influenced the genetic relatedness among sampled individuals. Sex-specific analyses revealed that rivers significantly limited dispersal only for females while highways only had marginal effects. Rivers and highways did not significantly affect male dispersal. These results support the contention that female skunks are more philopatric than males. Overall, our results suggest that the effects of major rivers and highways on dispersal are sex-specific and rather weak and are thus unlikely to prevent the spread of rabies within and among striped skunk populations. {\textcopyright} 2012 Talbot et al.},

In four of the five populations, the contribution of phenotypic variability was greater than the contribution of environmental variability, although not significantly so. The similarity in the contributions of environment and phenotype suggests that neither is worthy of neglect.

abstract = {Selective harvest may lead to rapid evolutionary change. For large herbivores, trophy hunting removes males with large horns. That artificial selection, operating in opposition to sexual selection, can lead to undesirable consequences for management and conservation. There have been no comparisons of long-term changes in trophy size under contrasting harvest pressures. We analyzed horn measurements of Stone's rams (Ovis dalli stonei) harvested over 37 years in two large regions of British Columbia, Canada, with marked differences in hunting pressure to identify when selective hunting may cause a long-term decrease in horn growth. Under strong selective harvest, horn growth early in life and the number of males harvested declined respectively by 12{\%} and 45{\%} over the study period. Horn shape also changed over time: horn length became shorter for a given base circumference, likely because horn base is not a direct target of hunter selection. In contrast, under relatively lower hunting pressure, there were no detectable temporal trends in early horn growth, number of males harvested or horn length relative to base circumference. Trophy hunting is an important recreational activity and can generate substantial revenues for conservation. By providing a reproductive advantage to males with smaller horns and reducing the availability of desirable trophies, however, excessive harvest may have the undesirable long-term consequences of reducing both the harvest and the horn size of rams. These consequences can be avoided by limiting offtake.},

abstract = {Ecologists seek to understand the fitness consequences of variation in physiological markers, under the hypothesis that physiological state is linked to variability in individual condition and life history. Thus, ecologists are often interested in estimating correlations between entire suites of correlated traits, or biomarkers, but sample size limitations often do not allow us to do this properly when large numbers of traits or biomarkers are considered. Latent variables are a powerful tool to overcome this complexity. Recent statistical advances have enabled a new class of multivariate models—multivariate hierarchical modelling (MHM) with latent variables—which allow to statistically estimate unstructured covariances/correlations among traits with reduced constraints on the number of degrees of freedom to account in the model. It is thus possible to highlight correlated structures in potentially very large numbers of traits. Here, we apply MHM to evaluate the relative importance of individual differences and environmental effects on milk composition and identify the drivers of this variation. We ask whether variation in bighorn sheep milk affects offspring fitness. We evaluate whether mothers show repeatable individual differences in the concentrations of 11 markers of milk composition, and we investigate the relative importance of annual variability, maternal identity and morphological traits in structuring milk composition. We then use variance estimates to investigate how a subset of repeatable milk markers influence lamb summer survival. Repeatability of milk markers ranged from 0.05 to 0.64 after accounting for year-to-year variations. Milk composition was weakly but significantly associated with maternal mass in June and September, summer mass gain and winter mass loss. Variation explained by year-to-year fluctuations ranged from 0.07 to 0.91 suggesting a strong influence of environmental variability on milk composition. Milk composition did not affect lamb survival to weaning. Using joint models in ecological, physiological or behavioural contexts has the major advantage of decomposing a (co)variance/correlation matrix while being estimated with fewer parameters than in a “traditional” mixed-effects model. The joint models presented here complement a growing list of tools to analyse correlations at different hierarchical levels separately and may thus represent a partial solution to the conundrum of physiological complexity.},

abstract = {Migratory bird species that feed on air-borne insects are experiencing widespread regional declines, but these remain poorly understood. Agricultural intensification in the breeding range is often regarded as one of the main drivers of these declines. Here, we tested the hypothesis that body mass in breeding individuals should reflect habitat quality in an aerial insectivore, the tree swallow (Tachycineta bicolor), along a gradient of agricultural intensity. Our dataset was collected over 7 years (2005-2011) and included 2918 swallow captures and 1483 broods. Analyses revealed a substantial decline of the population over the course of the study (219{\%} occupancy rate), mirrored by decreasing body mass. This trend was especially severe in females, representing a total loss of 8{\%} of their mass. Reproductive success was negatively influenced by intensive agriculture, but did not decrease over time. Interestingly, variation in body mass was independent of breeding habitat quality, leading us to suggest that this decline in body mass may result from carry-over effects from non-breeding areas and affect population dynamics through reduced survival. This work contributes to the growing body of evidence suggesting that declines in migratory aerial insectivores are driven by multiple, complex factors requiring better knowledge of year-round habitat use. {\textcopyright} 2014 The Authors Published by the Royal Society.

We used a quantitative genetic approach to decompose the phenotypic (co)variance of several metabolic and behavioural measures into components of additive genetic, common environment and permanent environment variance in captive deer mice. We found significant additive genetic variance for two mass-independent metabolic measures (RMR and the average metabolic rate throughout the respirometry run) and two behavioural measures (time spent in centre and distance moved in a novel environment). We also detected positive additive genetic correlation between mass-independent RMR and distance moved (r A=0.78±0.23). Our results suggest that RMR and exploratory behaviour are functionally integrated traits in deer mice, providing empirical support for one of the connections within the pace-of-life syndrome hypothesis. {\textcopyright} 2011 The Authors.

Age at harvest increased over time, suggesting slower horn growth. Rams that experienced favorable environmental conditions early in life had rapid horn growth and were harvested at a younger age than rams with slower horn growth. Guided nonresident hunters did not harvest larger rams than residents, suggesting that few large rams were available. Resident hunter success declined in recent years. Despite an apparently stable population, successive cohorts produced a decreasing harvest of trophy rams. We suggest that unrestricted harvest based on a threshold horn size led to a decline in the availability of trophy rams. That decline is partly an inevitable consequence of selective hunting that removes larger rams.

abstract = {Translocation of animals to reinforce small populations is a widespread technique in conservation biology. Recent reviews of translocation science underline the need to monitor translocated individuals. We sought to quantify social integration within the resident population and acclimation to a new environment of translocated bighorn sheep (Ovis canadensis) in a wild population in Alberta, Canada. We used precise metrics to evaluate post-release sociality, behavior and growth of translocated individuals. We observed a gradual assimilation of relocated sheep in the local population through increased social network centrality and decreased avoidance of residents. Translocated sheep spent more time vigilant and increased vigilance when forming groups with local residents. The initial social integration of translocated individuals involved high rates of received aggression. Translocated sheep gained 19{\%} less mass than residents during the first summer following translocation. Females did not give birth until the third year following translocation. Our results suggest that translocated sheep required one year to acclimate to their new environment and socially integrate into the local population. This study provides empirical quantification of both social integration and temporal acclimation processes for population reinforcement programs of large mammals. It increases our understanding of post-release processes and will assist in evaluating future conservation actions.},

abstract = {In many parts of the world, farmland bird species are declining at faster rates than other birds. For aerial insectivores, this decline has been related to a parallel reduction in the abundance of their invertebrate prey in agricultural landscapes. While the effects of agricultural intensification (AI) on arthropod communities at the landscape level have been substantially studied in recent years, seasonal variation in these impacts has not been investigated. To assess the contention that intensive cultures negatively impact food resources for aerial insectivorous birds, we analyzed the spatiotemporal distribution patterns of Diptera, the main food resource for breeding Tree Swallows (Tachycineta bicolor), across a gradient of AI in southeastern Quebec, Canada. Linear mixed models computed from a data set of 5000 samples comprising {\textgreater}150 000 dipterans collected over three years (2006-2008) suggest that both Diptera abundance and biomass varied greatly during swallow breeding season, following a quadratic curve. Globally, AI had a negative effect on Diptera abundance (but not biomass), but year-by-year analyses showed that in one of three years (2008), dipterans were more abundant in agro-intensive landscapes. Analyses also revealed a significant interaction between the moment in the season and AI: In early June, Diptera abundances were similar regardless of the landscape, but differences increased as the season progressed, with highly intensive landscapes harboring fewer prey, possibly creating an "ecological trap" for aerial insectivores. While global trends in our results are in agreement with expectations (negative impact of AI on insect abundance), strong discrepancies in 2008 highlight the difficulty of predicting the abundance of insect communities. Our study indicates that predicting the effects of AI may prove more challenging than generally assumed, even when large data sets are collected, and that temporal variation within a season is important to take into consideration. While further work is required to assess the direct impacts of these seasonal trends in Diptera abundance on bird breeding success and post-fledging survival, management strategies in agricultural landscapes may need to consider the phenology of breeding birds and their dipteran prey in order to mitigate the potentially negative effects of AI late in the breeding season. {\textcopyright} 2013 by the Ecological Society of America.},

abstract = {1. In long-lived species, adult survival is an important life-history trait. Better knowledge of the effects of non-catastrophic climate variation on the adult survival of long-lived seabirds is therefore needed. However, documentation of such effects is still rare. 2. Using capture-mark-resighting data, we modelled the annual survival rates of five species of seabirds, the common guillemot (Uria aalge), Br̈nnich's guillemot (Uria lomvia), razorbill (Alca torda), Atlantic puffin (Fratercula arctica) and black-legged kittiwake (Rissa tridactyla). The data spanned 14 years of observation at a colony on Horn{\o}ya, off Northern Norway in the western Barents Sea. 3. A method of taking into account ring-loss of marked individuals is proposed. This approach made it possible to keep many observations which otherwise would have to be discarded. 4. The estimated survival rates were higher and less variable than most estimates for the same species from other colonies. There was extensive resighting heterogeneity. Ignoring this effect would have underestimated breeding life span by more than 50{\%} in some species. 5. The analysis presented is the first study to document a correlation between the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) index and adult survival in North Atlantic seabirds. Other environmental variables considered were sea surface temperatures (SST) and prey stocks. In most of the species, models incorporating climatological variables were considerably better supported than models with constant survival, time-dependent survival or prey effects. SSTs tended to explain more of the variability in seabird survival than did the NAO. 6. The importance of prey availability was evident in some of the species, but climate was generally a better predictor of survival. Nevertheless, the evidence suggests that meteorological parameters affect seabird mortality only indirectly, possibly through the food chain. This conclusion rests on the observations that most NAO effects are lagged, and that survival rates decreased with increasing SSTs. {\textcopyright} 2005 British Ecological Society.},

abstract = {Understanding the consequences of environmental change on both long- and short-term ecological and evolutionary dynamics is a basic pre-requisite for any effective conservation or management programme but inherently problematic because of the complex interplay between ecological and evolutionary processes. Components of such complexity have been described in isolation or within conceptual models on numerous occasions. What remains lacking are studies that characterise effectively the coupled ecological and evolutionary dynamics, to demonstrate feedback mechanisms that influence both phenotypic change, and its effects on population demography, in organisms with complex life histories. We present a systems-based approach that brings together multiple effects that 'shape' an organism's life history (e.g. direct and delayed life-history consequences of environmental variation) and the resulting eco-evolutionary population dynamics. Using soil mites in microcosms, we characterise ecological, phenotypic and evolutionary dynamics in replicated populations in response to experimental manipulations of environment (e.g. the competitive environment, female age, male quality). Our results demonstrate that population dynamics are complex and are affected by both plastic and evolved responses to past and present environments, and that the emergent population dynamic itself shaped the landscape for natural selection to act on in subsequent generations. Evolutionary and ecological effects on dynamics can therefore be almost impossible to partition, which needs to be considered and appreciated in research, management and conservation. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

Those declines have been hypothetically attributed to a decrease in prey availability caused by agricultural intensification, but empirical evidence remains scarce. Here, we quantify the effect of landscape composition on the abundance and diversity of potential prey of Tree Swallows (Tachycineta bicolor (Vieillot, 1808)) and on nestling diet in southern Quebec, Canada. We collected food boluses from nestlings and compared their composition with spatiotemporally corresponding samples from traps on farms distributed along a gradient of agricultural intensification. The diet of nestlings was mostly composed of Diptera, both in biomass and abundance, but by mid-June, these decreased with increasing proportions of intensively cultivated crops within 500 m of the nests. Trap catches for Diptera and all arthropods combined followed the same trends. Yet, the associations between Diptera subgroups (Nematocera, non-schizophoran Brachycera, Schizophora (Calyptratae), and Schizophora (Acalyptratae)) and landscape composition differed between traps and boluses, suggesting that prey selection was altered by agricultural intensification. Our results suggest that agriculture can alter the availability of preferred prey for aerial insectivores, and further studies should evaluate the impact of prey availability to explain the decline of aerial insectivores.},

In species with sexually selected infanticide (SSI), hunting may decrease juvenile survival by increasing male turnover. We aimed to evaluate the relative importance of direct and indirect effects of hunting via SSI on the population dynamics of the Scandinavian brown bear (Ursus arctos). We performed prospective and retrospective demographic perturbation analyses for periods with low and high hunting pressures. All demographic rates, except yearling survival, were lower under high hunting pressure, which led to a decline in population growth under high hunting pressure ($\lambda$ = 0.975; 95{\%} CI = 0.914-1.011). Hunting had negative indirect effects on the population through an increase in SSI, which lowered cub survival and possibly also fecundity rates. Our study suggests that SSI could explain 13.6{\%} of the variation in population growth. Hunting also affected the relative importance of survival and fecundity of adult females for population growth, with fecundity being more important under low hunting pressure and survival more important under high hunting pressure. Our study sheds light on the importance of direct and indirect effects of hunting on population dynamics, and supports the contention that hunting can have indirect negative effects on populations through SSI.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2019 The Authors. Journal of Animal Ecology {\textcopyright} 2019 British Ecological Society Fitness costs of reproduction are expected when resources are limited. Costs drive the evolution of life-history strategies and can affect population dynamics if females change their allocation of resources to reproduction. We studied fitness costs of reproduction in mountain ungulates in Alberta, Canada. We monitored two populations of bighorn sheep (Ovis canadensis) for 44 and 30 years, and one of mountain goats (Oreamnos americanus) for 30 years. Both species are highly iteroparous. Heterogeneity in individual reproductive potential makes fitness costs of reproduction difficult to detect and quantify without manipulations. In capital breeders, individual differences can be partly accounted for by considering body mass and other correlates of reproductive potential. Long-term monitoring can reveal costs that only manifest under stressful conditions such as disease or resource scarcity. Despite individual differences in reproductive potential, we detected fitness costs of reproduction in females. Costs, in terms of mass gain and survival, are almost entirely born by subsequent offspring, as mothers prioritize their own maintenance and survival. Costs are greater for primiparous females, decrease with increasing body mass and increase as resource availability declines, and sons are costlier than daughters. Costs may increase for senescent females that appear to reduce allocation to reproduction. In bighorn sheep, costs mostly involve reduced mass gain and lower survival of subsequent offspring. In mountain goats, costs include reductions in mass gain, subsequent fecundity and juvenile survival. In males, fitness costs derive mostly from attempts to reproduce rather than from siring success and likely depend upon individual competitiveness. In the absence of selective harvests, dominant males may enjoy high fitness and possibly lower costs compared to subordinates. The conservative reproductive tactic of mountain ungulate females likely explains why density dependence mostly involves later primiparity and lower recruitment, but rarely affects adult survival. Future research will seek to better account for heterogeneity in reproductive potential, assess cumulative reproductive costs and investigate the potential effects of fathers on maternal allocation tactics.},

Growing experimental evidence, modeling studies, and field observations have revealed that common responses to harvest include changes in life-history and behavioral traits, which have the potential to reshape the ecology of harvested systems. On the basis of existing evidence, we propose a set of general mechanisms that link harvest-driven trait changes to ecological processes, including trophic cascades, nutrient dynamics, keystone interactions, ecosystem stability, and habitat use. Managing harvested ecosystems sustainably may require strategies that account for harvest-driven trait changes. We recommend that trait changes be monitored closely as part of ecosystem-based management plans, especially in cases where targeted traits are known to affect important aspects of ecosystem function.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature. Abstract: In the sexual conflict over the duration of maternal care, male mammals may improve their reproductive success by forcing early mother–offspring separation in species where lactation supresses estrus. However, when individual females benefit from continuing to care for their current offspring, they should adopt counter-strategies to avoid separation from offspring. Here, we tested whether spatial segregation from adult males and proximity to humans during the mating season could be associated with longer maternal care in the Scandinavian brown bear (Ursus arctos). Using resource selection functions (RSFs), we contrasted habitat selection patterns of adult males and those of adult females with yearlings that either provided 1.5 years of maternal care (“short-care females”) or continued care for an additional year (“long-care females”) during the mating season, the period when family break-ups typically occur. Males and short-care females had similar habitat selection patterns during the mating season. In contrast, habitat selection patterns differed between males and long-care females, suggesting spatial segregation between the two groups. In particular, long-care females used areas closer to human habitations compared with random locations (defined here as selection), whereas males used areas further to human habitations compared with random locations (defined here as avoidance). Our results show a correlation between habitat selection behavior and the duration of maternal care. We suggest that proximity to humans during the mating season may represent a female tactic to avoid adverse interactions with males that may lead to early weaning of offspring. Significance statement: In mammalian species where lactation supresses ovulation, males may gain a reproductive advantage by forcing early mother-offspring separation; however females can respond through behavioral tactics. We show that female brown bears with yearling cubs can spatially segregate from males during the mating season and that this behavior is associated with longer maternal care. Females selecting areas close to human habitations tend to keep their yearlings for an additional year, suggesting that human presence could have a shielding effect from males. Our study is among the few to explore sexual conflicts over the duration of maternal care close to weaning and shows that animals have the potential to adjust their behavioral tactics to make use of human-dominated landscapes.},

abstract = {There is a growing recognition of the importance of indirect effects from hunting on wildlife populations, e.g. social and behavioural changes due to harvest, which occur after the initial offtake. Nonetheless, little is known about how the removal of members of a population influences the spatial configuration of the survivors. We studied how surviving brown bears (Ursus arctos) used former home ranges that had belonged to casualties of the annual bear hunting season in southcentral Sweden (2007–2015). We used resource selection functions to explore the effects of the casualty's and survivor's sex, age and their pairwise genetic relatedness, population density and hunting intensity on survivors' spatial responses to vacated home ranges. We tested the competitive release hypothesis, whereby survivors that increase their use of a killed bear's home range are presumed to have been released from intraspecific competition. We found strong support for this hypothesis, as survivors of the same sex as the casualty consistently increased their use of its vacant home range. Patterns were less pronounced or absent when the survivor and casualty were of opposite sex. Genetic relatedness between the survivor and the casualty emerged as the most important factor explaining increased use of vacated male home ranges by males, with a stronger response from survivors of lower relatedness. Relatedness was also important for females, but it did not influence use following removal; female survivors used home ranges of higher related female casualties more, both before and after death. Spatial responses by survivors were further influenced by bear age, population density and hunting intensity. We have shown that survivors exhibit a spatial response to vacated home ranges caused by hunting casualties, even in nonterritorial species such as the brown bear.

The ability to predict ecological responses has often been hampered by our rather limited understanding of trophic interactions. Indeed, it has proven difficult to discern direct and indirect effects of environmental change on animal populations owing to limited information about vegetation at large temporal and spatial scales. The rapidly increasing use of the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) in ecological studies has recently changed this situation.

We examined the determinants of natural litter size variation and quantified the effects of litter size, maternal characteristics, and litter composition on yearling mass using 24 years of data on marked brown bears (Ursus arctos) in Sweden. Infanticide by adult males is a major cause of cub-of-the-year mortality, leading to litter size reductions. Litter size (n = 265) at den emergence ranged from one to four cubs (average, 2. 7) and increased with maternal age. Litter size, however, appeared independent of maternal size, population density, interlitter interval, study area, or previous litter sex ratio. Yearling body mass increased with maternal body size but was independent of litter sex ratio. Litter size and yearling mass were negatively correlated, mostly because singletons were about 30 {\%} heavier than yearlings from litters of two to four cubs. In reduced litters, survivors were on average 8 {\%} heavier as yearlings than individuals from intact litters, suggesting that sibling competition reduces growth. Trade-offs between litter size and yearling mass in bears appear similar in magnitude to those found in small mammals. {\textcopyright} 2012 Springer-Verlag.},

Based on a population of Tree swallows (Tachycineta bicolor) monitored over 10,200 km2 in Southern Qu{\'{e}}bec, Canada, since 2004, we investigated how patterns of selection may change across breeding stages by dividing the overall selection at the nesting stage (number of fledglings produced) into hatchling (number of hatchlings produced) and fledgling (number of hatchlings having successfully fledged) selection stages. We assessed fluctuation in selection gradients on two morphological (body mass and wing length) and two reproductive (laying date and clutch size) traits in females. We found significant positive selection gradients for body mass and clutch size and negative selection gradients for laying date, though the latter only during the fledgling selection stage. We also found that selection gradients on reproductive traits significantly fluctuated in direction and/or strength among years but only during the hatchling breeding stage. Our results thus emphasize the need to consider how selection events may be fluctuating in time and among breeding stages and the importance of these patterns for the maintenance of phenotypic variation in wild populations.},

While some researchers use antibodies against the parent hormone (which is typically absent from fecal samples), others advocate the use of antibodies designed to detect glucocorticoid metabolites. We validated two assays to monitor fecal cortisol metabolites in the eastern chipmunk (Tamias striatus). We compared an antibody produced against cortisol and one produced against 5a-pregnane-3b, 11b, 21-triol-20-one using a radiometabolism study and an injection with adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH). Most cortisol metabolites were excreted in the urine ({\~{}}83{\%}). Peak excretion in the feces occurred 8 h after injection. Both assays detected an increase in fecal cortisol metabolite levels after injection of ACTH. Males, but not females, exhibited a circadian variation in metabolite levels. The sexes did not exhibit any difference over the time course and route of excretion or the relative increase in fecal cortisol metabolite levels after ACTH injection. The cortisol assay displayed higher reactivity to ACTH injection relative to baseline than did the metabolite assay. While both antibodies gave comparable results, the cortisol antibody was more sensitive to changes in plasma cortisol levels in eastern chipmunks. {\textcopyright} 2012 by The University of Chicago.

abstract = {The effects of phyto-pharmaceutic compounds (PPCs), such as neonicotinoids, on wildlife reproduction and survival are a rising concern. Yet, understanding the biological consequences of PPC use is particularly complex given the large diversity of PPCs and their derivatives to which wildlife can be exposed. Here, we present a simple and sensitive method for the simultaneous detection and quantification of multiclass PPCs (54 molecules) in single insect boluses ({\textless}0.05 g dry mass) by ultra-high pressure liquid chromatography coupled to a tandem mass spectrometer (LC-MS/MS). A key part of this new method is the use of a two-step extraction method combining (i) the high efficiency of a microwave-assisted solvent extraction (MAE) for extracting analytes that might be tightly bound to environmental matrices and (ii) the versatility of a salt-out effect adapted from the QuEChERS methodology allowing the extraction and purification of a wide array of analytes. This microwave-assisted salt-out extraction (MASOE) approach was compared to classical extraction methods including matrix solid phase dispersion (MSPD), microwave-assisted extraction (MAE), and the QuEChERS method. Average recoveries for 54 analytes ranged from 49{\%} to 106{\%}, (relative standard deviations {\textless}22{\%}). The limits of detection (LODs) and quantification (LOQs) were in the ranges of 0.10-3.00 ng g-1 and 0.40-7.00 ng g-1, respectively. We applied this method to analyse 881 insect boluses collected from Tree Swallow (Tachycineta bicolour) nestlings along an agricultural intensification gradient in southern Qu{\'{e}}bec (Canada). We detected 25 PPCs out of the 54 considered. We detected at least one PPC in 30{\%} of samples and were able to quantify at least one of them in 17{\%} of samples. Our study shows that the MASOE method should prove to be a powerful tool for studying the fate and impacts of PPCs on wildlife.},

abstract = {Abstract: Conspicuous coloration in males of numerous bird species has been related to sexual selection. However, iridescent coloration is a complex trait that has received little attention despite its potential importance as a signal of individual condition. Directionality, the change in brightness when the animal moves under direct sunlight, has never been linked to fitness although being an integral part of iridescent coloration. Using 214 male tree swallows (Tachycineta bicolor) from a 2-year study, we investigated how different components of iridescent coloration were related to four measures of fitness (number of extra-pair and within-pair young produced, proportion of within-pair young in the nest and annual reproductive success) across different breeding densities. In addition to classical components of coloration (hue, brightness, saturation), we used directionality—measured as an angular breadth of color reflection—to quantify the iridescent coloration of male crown and back. Our results showed that all components of iridescent coloration we studied were related to at least one of the four measures of fitness. A negative association was detected between directionality and the number of within-pair young produced, suggesting that this plumage characteristic could be a signal of paternal care. Crown and back coloration were associated to different fitness components, and density modulated the slope of some of these relationships. Altogether, our results showed that different selective pressures could act on the multiple components of iridescent coloration via both within-pair and extra-pair components of reproductive success. Also, environmental conditions like breeding density are important factors influencing sexual selection processes. Significance statement: The idea that colorful plumage in males is the result of sexual selection is widely recognized. However, evidence of sexual selection on iridescent plumage is scarce. In birds displaying iridescent plumage, the brightness change occurring when the bird moves, called directionality, is striking and could be informative for females when choosing a mate. Using 214 male tree swallows, we found that directionality was related to the number of young produced by a male. As nests were distributed in 40 different farms, a high variability of breeding densities occurred in the study system. Breeding density highly influenced the relationship between color components of iridescent plumage and the number of young produced by a male. This study emphasizes the importance to quantify the angular properties of iridescent plumage as well as to take into account breeding density when studying sexual selection.},

Anthropogenic disturbance therefore led to habitat loss in this protected area because during days with heavy traffic, ungulates avoided habitat close to the road.

Raccoon rabies variant (RRV) is a zoonosis of concern for humans because its main vector, the raccoon (Procyon lotor), is found near residential areas. In Qu{\'{e}}bec, Canada, all cases of RRV found in raccoons since 2006 were detected on the eastern side of the Richelieu River, suggesting that this river acts as a barrier to gene flow and thus the potential for RRV to spread. The objectives of this study were to characterize the genetic structure of raccoon populations and assess the effect of the Richelieu River on the population structure in southern Qu{\'{e}}bec, Canada. We also evaluated whether RRV spread potential differed between sex and at a larger spatial scale. Our analyses revealed a weak signal of genetic differentiation among individuals located on each side of the Richelieu River. At a larger spatial scale, genetic structuring was weak. Our results suggest that rivers might not always efficiently restrain raccoon movements and spread of RRV. We suggest that the difference in genetic structure found between sexes can be partly explained by male movements during the breeding season in winter, when ice bridges allow passage over most rivers in Qu{\'{e}}bec. {\textcopyright} 2012 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.},

abstract = {The reliability and consistency of the many measures proposed to quantify sexual selection have been questioned for decades. Realized selection on quantitative characters measured by the selection differential i was approximated by metrics based on variance in breeding success, using either the opportunity for sexual selection Is or indices of inequality. There is no consensus about which metric best approximates realized selection on sexual characters. Recently, the opportunity for selection on character mean OSM was proposed to quantify the maximum potential selection on characters. Using 21 years of data on bighorn sheep (Ovis canadensis), we investigated the correlations between seven indices of inequality, Is, OSM and i on horn length of males. Bighorn sheep are ideal for this comparison because they are highly polygynous and sexually dimorphic, ram horn length is under strong sexual selection, and we have detailed knowledge of individual breeding success. Different metrics provided conflicting information, potentially leading to spurious conclusions about selection patterns. I$\delta$, an index of breeding inequality, and, to a lesser extent, Is showed the highest correlation with i on horn length, suggesting that these indices document breeding inequality in a selection context. OSM on horn length was strongly correlated with i, Is and indices of inequality. By integrating information on both realized sexual selection and breeding inequality, OSM appeared to be the best proxy of sexual selection and may be best suited to explore its ecological bases.},

abstract = {Density-dependence is a key concept in population dynamics. Here, we review how body mass and demographic parameters vary with population density in large herbivores. The demographic parameters we consider are age- and sex-specific reproduction, survival and dispersal. As population density increases, the body mass of large herbivores typically declines, affecting individual performance traits such as age of first reproduction and juvenile survival. We documented density-dependent variations in reproductive rates for many species from the Arctic to subtropical zones, both with and without predation. At high density, a trade-off between growth and reproduction delays the age of primiparity and often increases the costs of reproduction, decreasing both survival and future reproductive success of adult females. Density-dependent preweaning juvenile survival occurs more often in polytocous than monotocous species, while the effects of density on post-weaning juvenile survival are independent of litter size. Responses of adult survival to density are much less marked than for juvenile survival, and may be exaggerated by density-dependent changes in age structure. The role of density-dependent dispersal in population dynamics remains uncertain, because very few studies have examined it. For sexually dimorphic species, we found little support for higher sensitivity to increasing density in the life history traits of males compared to females, except for young age classes. It remains unclear whether males of dimorphic species are sensitive to male density, female density or a combination of both. Eberhardt's model predicting a sequential effect of density on demographic parameters (from juvenile survival to adult survival) was supported by 9 of 10 case studies. In addition, population density at birth can also lead to cohort effects, including a direct effect on juvenile survival and long-term effects on average cohort performance as adults. Density effects typically interact with weather, increasing in strength in years of harsh weather. For some species, the synchronization between plant phenology and reproductive cycle is a key process in population dynamics. The timing of late gestation as a function of plant phenology determines whether density-dependence influences juvenile survival or adult female reproduction. The detection of density-dependence can be made difficult by nonlinear relationships with density, high sampling variability, lagged responses to density changes, changes in population age structure, and temporal variation in the main factors limiting population growth.

abstract = {The evolution of reproductive strategies is affected by the ability of organisms to deal with future environmental conditions. When environments are temporally unpredictable, however, it is difficult to anticipate optimal offspring phenotype. Diversification of offspring phenotypes, a strategy called diversified bet-hedging, may allow parents to maximize their fitness by reducing between-year variation in reproductive success. The link between diversification of offspring phenotypes and individual reproductive success, however, has rarely been documented empirically. We used an eight-year dataset (1215 broods, 870 females) on individually marked tree swallows (Tachycineta bicolor) to assess whether intra-brood mass variation was compatible with a diversified bet-hedging strategy. Intra-brood mass variation was weakly, but significantly repeatable within females, suggesting consistent individual differences. Greater intra-brood mass variation, however, was not associated with reduced between-year variation in reproductive success or increased female reproductive success. Moreover, contrary to diversified bet-hedging expectations, fledging success of large broods was greater when hatchlings had similar rather than variable masses. Our results suggest that intra-brood mass variation may not result from diversified bet-hedging, but rather from complex interactions between environmental, brood, and maternal characteristics.},

abstract = {The evolution of conspicuous sexually selected traits, such as horns or antlers,has fascinated biologists for more than a century. Elaborate traits can only evolve if they substantially increase reproduction, because they probably incur survival costs to the bearer. Total selection on these traits, however,includes sexual selection on sires and viability selection on offspring and can be influenced by changes in each of these components. Non-random associations between paternal phenotype and offspring viability may thus affect total selection on sexually selected traits. Long-term data on wild bighorn sheep (Ovis canadensis) provide the first evidence in nature that association between paternal phenotype and lamb viability strengthens total selection on horn size of adult rams, a sexually selected trait. The association of paternal horn length and offspring viability was sexually antagonistic: long-horned males sired sonswith high viability but daughters of lowviability. These results shed newlight on the evolutionary dynamics of an iconic sexually selected trait and have important implications for sustainable wildlife management.},

Heterozygote advantage and/or good genes should shape mate choice originating from pathogen/parasite-driven selection at immune genes. However, the stability of these associations, and whether they vary with environmental conditions, are still rarely documented. In this study, we describe mating patterns in a wild population of tree swallows ( Tachycineta bicolor ) over 4 years and assess the effects of haemosporidian parasite infection and immune genetic diversity at $\beta$-defensin genes on those patterns within two habitats of contrasting environmental quality, in southern Qu{\'{e}}bec, Canada. We first show that mating patterns were only very weakly related to individual status of infection by haemosporidian parasites. However, we found a difference between habitats in mating patterns related to infection status, which was likely due to a non-random distribution of individuals, as non-infected mating pairs were more frequent in lower quality habitats. Mating patterns also differed depending on $\beta$-defensin heterozygosity at AvBD2, but only for genetic partners outside of the social couple, with heterozygous individuals pairing together. Our study underlines the importance of considering habitat heterogeneity in studies of sexual selection.},

abstract = {Isolation of small populations is expected to reduce fitness through inbreeding and loss of genetic variation, impeding population growth and compromising population persistence. Species with long generation time are the least likely to be rescued by evolution alone. Management interventions that maintain or restore genetic variation to assure population viability are consequently of significant importance. We investigated, over 27 years, the genetic and demographic consequences of a demographic bottleneck followed by artificial supplementation in an isolated population of bighorn sheep (Ovis canadensis). Based on a long-term pedigree and individual monitoring, we documented the genetic decline, restoration and rescue of the population. Microsatellite analyses revealed that the demographic bottleneck reduced expected heterozygosity and allelic diversity by 6.2{\%} and 11.3{\%}, respectively, over two generations. Following supplementation, first-generation admixed lambs were 6.4{\%} heavier at weaning and had 28.3{\%} higher survival to 1 year compared to lambs of endemic ancestry. Expected heterozygosity and allelic diversity increased by 4.6{\%} and 14.3{\%} after two generations through new alleles contributed by translocated individuals. We found no evidence for outbreeding depression and did not see immediate evidence of swamping of local genes. Rapid intervention following the demographic bottleneck allowed the genetic restoration and rescue of this bighorn sheep population, likely preventing further losses at both the genetic and demographic levels. Our results provide further empirical evidence that translocation can be used to reduce inbreeding depression in nature and has the potential to mitigate the effect of human-driven environmental changes on wild populations.},

abstract = {Individuals experiencing poor growth early in life may later make up their size deficit. Compensatory growth or growth prolongation may lead to such catch-up, involving different lifehistory trade-offs under natural conditions. Frequent recaptures and detailed monitoring of animals surviving to asymptotic size are required to compare growth tactics and their fitness consequences. No study to date has obtained such detailed information for wild animals. We used repeated mass measurements (mean 11.6/animal) spanning the lifetime of 104 bighorn ewes (Ovis canadensis) to quantify growth tactics and identify the determinants and life-history costs of these tactics. Growth prolongation, not compensatory growth, led to partial catch-up: mass difference at age 7 was reduced to 4{\%}, for two groups that differed by nearly 20{\%} as yearlings. Ewes that had been light as yearlings prolonged their growth regardless of density or age of primiparity. Growth prolongation did not affect fecundity or longevity. Ewes that experienced poor early growth prolonged growth at the expense of reproductive fitness, weaning a smaller proportion of their lambs. By tracking multiyear growth patterns and comparing events at different life-history stages, we quantified a trade-off between growth and reproduction that would be overlooked if only the adult phenotype was considered. Compensatory growth in long-lived animals appears unlikely when early growth restrictions are mostly density dependent. {\textcopyright} 2013 by The University of Chicago. All rights reserved.},

We used detailed longterm data from three populations of large herbivores with generation times ranging from four to nine years to quantify heterogeneity in individual quality among females, and to assess its influence on mean annual reproductive success over the lifetime (MRS). We also determined how environmental conditions in early life shaped individual quality and tested A. Lomnicki's hypothesis that variance in individual quality should increase when environmental conditions deteriorate. Using multivariate analyses (PCA), we identified one (in sheep and deer) or two (in goats) covariations among life-history traits (longevity, success in the last breeding opportunity, adult mass, and social rank) as indexes of individual quality that positively influenced MRS of females. Individual quality was reduced by unfavorable weather, low resource availability, and high population density in the year of birth. Early-life conditions accounted for 35-55{\%} of variation in individual quality. In roe deer, we found greater variance in individual quality for cohorts born under unfavorable conditions as opposed to favorable ones, but the opposite was found in bighorn sheep and mountain goats. Our results demonstrate that heterogeneity in female quality can originate from environmental conditions in early life and can markedly influence the fitness of females in species located at different positions along the slow-fast continuum of life-history strategies. {\textcopyright} 2009 by the Ecological Society of America.},

abstract = {1. Trade-offs in resource allocation underline the evolution of life-history traits but their expression is frequently challenged by empirical findings. In large herbivores, males with large antlers or horns typically have high mating success. The fitness costs of large horns or antlers have rarely been quantified although they are controversial. 2. Here, using detailed longitudinal data on n = 172 bighorn (Ovis canadensis, Shaw) and the capture-mark-recapture methodology, we tested whether early horn growth leads to a survival cost in rams ('trade-off' hypothesis) or if males that can afford rapid horn growth survive better than males of lower phenotypic quality ('phenotypic quality' hypothesis). We also quantified how hunting increased survival costs of bearing large horns. 3. We found an age-specific relationship between horn growth and survival. In all age classes, natural survival was either weakly related to (lambs, adult rams) or positively associated (yearling rams) with early horn growth. Hunting mortality was markedly different from natural mortality of bighorn rams, leading to an artificial negative association between early horn growth and survival. Beginning at age 4, the yearly harvest rate ranged from 12{\%} for males with the smallest horns up to more than 40{\%} for males with the largest horns. 4. Growing large horns early in life is not related to any consistent survival costs, hence supporting the phenotypic quality hypothesis in males of a dimorphic and polygynous large herbivores. Rapid horn growth early in life is, however, strongly counter selected by trophy hunting. We suggest that horn size is a very poor index of reproductive effort and that males modulate their mating activities and energy allocation to horn growth to limit its impact on survival. {\textcopyright} 2008 The Authors.},

In this paper, we develop an approach to combine these methods and apply it to detailed data from Soay sheep (Ovis aries). We examine how density dependence and climate contribute to fluctuations in population size via age- and sex-specific demographic rates, and how fluctuations in demographic structure influence population dynamics. Density dependence contributes most, followed by climatic variation, age structure fluctuations and interactions between density and climate. We then simplify the density-dependent, stochastic, age-structured demographic model and derive a new phenomenological time series which captures the dynamics better than previously selected functions. The simple method we develop has potential to provide substantial insight into the relative contributions of population and individual-level processes to the dynamics of populations in stochastic environments. {\textcopyright} 2008 by the Ecological Society of America.},

abstract = {Isodar theory can be used to evaluate fitness consequences of density-dependent habitat selection by animals. A typical habitat isodar is a regression curve plotting competitor densities in two adjacent habitats when individual fitness is equal. Despite the increasing use of habitat isodars, their application remains largely limited to areas composed of pairs of adjacent habitats that are defined a priori. We developed a resampling method that uses data from wildlife surveys to build isodars in heterogeneous landscapes without having to predefine habitat types. The method consists in randomly placing blocks over the survey area and dividing those blocks in two adjacent sub-blocks of the same size. Animal abundance is then estimated within the two sub-blocks. This process is done 100 times. Different functional forms of isodars can be investigated by relating animal abundance and differences in habitat features between sub-blocks. We applied this method to abundance data of raccoons and striped skunks, two of the main hosts of rabies virus in North America. Habitat selection by raccoons and striped skunks depended on both conspecific abundance and the difference in landscape composition and structure between sub-blocks. When conspecific abundance was low, raccoons and striped skunks favored areas with relatively high proportions of forests and anthropogenic features, respectively. Under high conspecific abundance, however, both species preferred areas with rather large corn-forest edge densities and corn field proportions. Based on random sampling techniques, we provide a robust method that is applicable to a broad range of species, including medium- to large-sized mammals with high mobility. The method is sufficiently flexible to incorporate multiple environmental covariates that can reflect key requirements of the focal species. We thus illustrate how isodar theory can be used with wildlife surveys to assess density-dependent habitat selection over large geographic extents.},

Stochastic switches in limiting factors that persist for multiple time-steps have received little attention, but most wild populations may periodically experience such switches. Here, we consider the dynamics of three populations of individually marked bighorn sheep (Ovis canadensis) monitored for 24-28 years. Each population experienced one or two distinct cougar (Puma concolor) predation events leading to population declines. The onset and duration of predation events were stochastic and consistent with predation by specialist individuals. A realistic Markov chain model confirms that predation by specialist cougars can cause extinction of isolated populations. We suggest that such processes may be common. In such cases, predator-prey equilibria may only occur at large geographical and temporal scales, and are unlikely with increasing habitat fragmentation. {\textcopyright} 2006 The Royal Society.},

abstract = {Heterozygosity has been associated with components of fitness in numerous studies across a wide range of taxa. Because heterozygosity is associated with individual performance it is also expected to be associated with population dynamics. However, investigations into the association between heterozygosity and population dynamics have been rare because of difficulties in linking evolutionary and ecological processes. The choice of heterozygosity measure is a further issue confounding such studies as it can be biased by individual differences in the frequencies of the alleles studied, the number of alleles at each locus as well as the total number of loci typed. In this study, we first examine the differences between the principal metrics used to calculate heterozygosity using long-term data from a marked population of Soay sheep (Ovis aries). Next, by means of statistical transformation of the homozygosity weighted by loci index, we determine how heterozygosity contributes to population growth in Soay sheep by modelling individual contributions to population growth (pt(i)) as a function of several covariates, including sex, weight and faecal egg count - a surrogate of parasitic nematode burden in the gut. We demonstrate that although heterozygosity is associated with some components of fitness, most notably adult male reproductive success, in general it is only weakly associated with population growth. {\textcopyright} 2011 Di Fonzo et al.},

In birds, phenotypic plasticity in response to temperature is thought to be the main mechanism underlying yearly adjustment in the timing of breeding. However, other factors could be important and interact to affect the levels of plastic responses between and/or within-individuals. Here, we use long-term individual-based data on tree swallow (Tachycineta bicolor) to identify the spatial and environmental drivers affecting plasticity in laying date and to assess their importance at both population and individual levels. We found that laying date has advanced by 4.2 days over 10 years, and that it was mainly influenced by latitude and an interaction between spring temperature and breeder density. Analyses of individual plasticity showed that increases in temperature, but not in breeder density, resulted in within-individual advances in laying date. Our results suggest that females can adjust their laying date as a function of temperature, but that this adjustment will be partly constrained in habitats with lower breeder densities. Such potential constraint is especially worrying for the broad array of species already declining as a result of climate change.},

We monitored for 27years a bighorn sheep (Ovis canadensis) population that declined dramatically as episodes of cougar (Puma concolor) predation depressed survival. Predation led to a positive relationship between lamb survival and population size below a threshold, and to an overall positive relationship between yearling and adult ewe survival and population size. During years of high predation, lambs also suffer mortality through reduced growth, contributing a third of the total impact of predation on lamb survival. There was no positive association between population growth and population size, probably because growth was affected by several factors other than predation, including disease.

Our analyses revealed that the number of WPY was higher under better environmental conditions, while the number of EPY was mainly related to male characteristics. Males nesting in more intensive agricultural areas had fewer WPY produced and a lower reproductive success. Also, males breeding earlier in the season had more WPY. The presence of parasites reduced males' reproductive success, mainly by reducing the number of EPY. The influence of male phenotype varied according to population density: Tarsus length variation had a greater effect on reproductive success at low population density than at high density, while wing length was also positively related to the number of EPY, more so at high than at low density. Altogether, our results suggest a complex interplay between individual and environmental determinants of reproductive success and imply that sexual selection dynamics varies depending on environmental contexts. {\textcopyright} 2014 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

abstract = {The development of male secondary sexual characters such as antlers or horns has substantial biological and socio-economic importance because in many species these traits affect male fitness positively through sexual selection and negatively through trophy hunting. Both environmental conditions and selective hunting can affect horn growth but their relative importance remains unexplored. We first examined how a large-scale climate index, the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO), local weather and population density influenced both absolute and relative annual horn growth from birth to three years of male bighorn sheep Ovis canadensis over 42 years. We then examined the relative influence of environmental conditions and evolution mainly driven by trophy hunting on male horn length at three years of age. Horn growth was positively influenced by low population density and warm spring temperature, suggesting that ongoing climate change should lead to larger horns. Seasonal values of PDO were highly correlated. Horn growth increased with PDO in spring or summer at low density, but was weak at high density regardless of PDO. The interaction between population density and PDO in spring or summer accounted for a similar proportion of the observed annual variation in horn growth (32{\%} or 37{\%}) as did the additive effects of spring temperature and density (34{\%}). When environmental conditions deteriorated, males allocated relatively more resources to summer mass gain than to horn growth, suggesting a conservative strategy favoring maintenance of condition over allocation to secondary sexual characters. Population density explained 27{\%} of the variation in horn length, while evolutionary effects explained 9{\%} of the variance. Thus, our study underlines the importance of both evolution and phenotypic plasticity on the development of a secondary sexual trait.},

abstract = {Growing recognition of the importance of climate extremes as drivers of contemporary and future ecological dynamics has led to increasing interest in studying these locally and globally important phenomena. Many ecological studies examining the impacts of what are deemed climate extremes, such as heat waves and severe drought, do not provide a definition of extremity, either from a statistical context based on the long-term climatic record or from the perspective of the response of the system - are the effects extreme (unusual or profound) in comparison to normal variability? A synthetic definition of an extreme climatic event (ECE) is proposed that includes 'extremeness' in both the driver and the response: an ECE is as an episode or occurrence in which a statistically rare or unusual climatic period alters ecosystem structure and/or function well outside the bounds of what is considered typical or normal variability. This definition is accompanied by a mechanistic framework based on the concept that extreme response thresholds associated with significant community change and altered ecosystem function must be crossed in order for an ECE to occur. Synthesis. A definition and mechanistic framework for ECEs is used to identify priorities for future research that will enable ecologists to more fully assess the ecological consequences of climate extremes for ecosystem structure and function today and in a future world where their frequency and intensity are expected to increase. {\textcopyright} 2011 The Author.

abstract = {Egg production is a costly component of reproduction for female birds in terms of energy expenditure and maternal investment. Because resources are typically limited, clutch size and egg mass are expected to be constrained, and this putative trade-off between offspring number and size is at the core of life history theory. Nevertheless, empirical evidence for this trade-off is equivocal at best, as individual heterogeneity in resource acquisition and allocation may hamper the detection of the negative correlation between egg number and mass within populations. Here, we investigated how female body mass and landscape composition influences clutch size, egg mass, and the relationship between these two traits. To do so, we fitted linear mixed models using data from tree swallows Tachycineta bicolor breeding in a network of 400 nestboxes located along a gradient of agricultural intensity between 2004 and 2011. Our dataset comprised 1463 broods for clutch size analyses and 4371 eggs (from 847 broods laid between 2005–2008) for egg mass analyses. Our results showed that agricultural intensity negatively impacted clutch size, but not egg mass nor the relationship between these two traits. Female mass, on the other hand, modulated the trade-off between clutch size and egg mass. For heavier females, both traits increased jointly, without evidence of a trade-off. However, for lighter females, there was a clear negative relationship between clutch size and egg mass. This work shows that accounting for individual heterogeneity in body mass allows the detection of a clutch size/egg mass trade-off that would have remained undetected otherwise. Identifying habitat and individual effects on resource allocation towards reproductive traits may help bridging the gap between predictions from theory and empirical evidence on life history trade-offs.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2016 John Wiley {\&} Sons Ltd. The potential for selective harvests to induce rapid evolutionary change is an important question for conservation and evolutionary biology, with numerous biological, social and economic implications. We analyze 39 years of phenotypic data on horn size in bighorn sheep (Ovis canadensis) subject to intense trophy hunting for 23 years, after which harvests nearly ceased. Our analyses revealed a significant decline in genetic value for horn length of rams, consistent with an evolutionary response to artificial selection on this trait. The probability that the observed change in male horn length was due solely to drift is 9.9{\%}. Female horn length and male horn base, traits genetically correlated to the trait under selection, showed weak declining trends. There was no temporal trend in genetic value for female horn base circumference, a trait not directly targeted by selective hunting and not genetically correlated with male horn length. The decline in genetic value for male horn length stopped, but was not reversed, when hunting pressure was drastically reduced. Our analysis provides support for the contention that selective hunting led to a reduction in horn length through evolutionary change. It also confirms that after artificial selection stops, recovery through natural selection is slow.},

abstract = {Animal personality traits and the emergence of behavioural syndromes, i.e. between-individual correlation of behaviours, are commonly quantified from behavioural observations in controlled environments. Subjecting large and elusive wildlife to controlled test situations is, however, rarely possible, suggesting that ecologists should exploit alternative measures of behaviours for quantifying differences between individuals. Our goal was to test whether movement and space use data can be used to quantify behavioural syndromes in the wild. We quantified six behaviours from GPS and dual motion sensor tracking devices of 46 adult female brown bears followed in southcentral Sweden over the summer and early autumn. As well as daily travel distance, an indicator for activity, and daily displacement, an indicator for exploration, we quantified four behaviours that increase a bear's likelihood of encountering humans and could thus serve as indicators for boldness: diurnality, selection for roads and selection for two open habitat types, bogs and clearcuts, with low lateral cover. We tested (1) whether behaviours showed repeatable between-individual variation (animal personality) and (2) whether behaviours were correlated between individuals and thus formed a behavioural syndrome. Repeatability of behaviours ranged from 0.16 to 0.61 confirming between-individual variation in movement, activity and space use. A multivariate mixed model revealed significant positive correlations between travel distance, displacement and diurnality, suggesting the existence of an activity–exploration and potentially partial boldness syndrome in our bear population. Selection for exposed or human-frequented habitats were uncorrelated with the activity–exploration syndrome and with each other, albeit there was a trend for stronger road avoidance by bears that readily used clearcuts. We show that large tracking data sets can be used to quantify between-individual correlation in spatial behaviours. We suggest that delineating behavioural types from wildlife tracking data will be of increasing interest because of the importance of animal personality for ecological processes, wildlife conservation and human–wildlife coexistence.},

abstract = {Seasonal patterns of climate and vegetation growth are expected to be altered by global warming. In alpine environments, the reproduction of birds and mammals is tightly linked to seasonality; therefore such alterations may have strong repercussions on recruitment. We used the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), a satellite-based measurement that correlates strongly with aboveground net primary productivity, to explore how annual variations in the timing of vegetation onset and in the rate of change in primary production during green-up affected juvenile growth and survival of bighorn sheep (Ovis canadensis), Alpine ibex (Capra ibex), and mountain goats (Oreamnos americanus) in four different populations in two continents. We indexed timing of onset of vegetation growth by the integrated NDVI (INDVI) in May. The rate of change in primary production during green-up (early May to early July) was estimated as (1) the maximal slope between any two successive bimonthly NDVI values during this period and (2) the slope in NDVI between early May and early July. The maximal slope in NDVI was negatively correlated with lamb growth and survival in both populations of bighorn sheep, growth of mountain goat kids, and survival of Alpine ibex kids, but not with survival of mountain goat kids. There was no effect of INDVI in May and of the slope in NDVI between early May and early July on juvenile growth and survival for any species. Although rapid changes in NDVI during the green-up period could translate into higher plant productivity, they may also lead to a shorter period of availability of high-quality forage over a large spatial scale, decreasing the opportunity for mountain ungulates to exploit high-quality forage. Our results suggest that attempts to forecast how warmer winters and springs will affect animal population dynamics and life histories in alpine environments should consider factors influencing the rate of changes in primary production during green-up and the timing of vegetation onset. {\textcopyright} 2007 by the Ecological Society of America.},

abstract = {We know little about the determinants and demographic consequences of the marked seasonal mass changes exhibited by many northern and alpine mammals. We analysed 43 years of data on individual winter mass loss (the difference between mass in early June and mass in mid-September the previous year) and summer mass gain (the difference between mass in mid-September and in early June of the same year) in adult bighorn sheep (Ovis canadensis). We calculated relative seasonal mass change as a proportion of individual body mass at the start of each season. We first examined the effects of weather and population density on relative changes in body mass. We then assessed the consequences of relative seasonal mass changes on reproduction. Mean April–May temperature was the main driver of relative seasonal mass changes: warm springs reduced both relative winter mass loss and summer mass gain of both sexes, likely partially due to a trade-off between growth rate of plants and duration of access to high-quality forage. Because these effects cancelled each other, spring temperature did not influence mass in mid-September. Mothers that lost relatively more mass during the winter had lambs that gained less mass during summer, likely because these females allocated fewer resources to lactation. Winter survival of lambs increased with their summer mass gain. In males, relative mass loss during winter, which includes the rut, did not influence the probability of siring at least one lamb, possibly indicating that greater mating effort did not necessarily translate into greater reproductive success. Our findings improve our understanding of how weather influences recruitment and underline the importance of cryptic mechanisms behind the effects of climate change on demographic traits.},

abstract = {Selecting the right habitat in a risky landscape is crucial for an individual's survival and reproduction. In predator–prey systems, prey often can anticipate the habitat use of their main predator and may use protective associates (i.e. typically an apex predator) as shields against predation. Although never tested, such mechanisms should also evolve in systems in which sexual conflict affects offspring survival. Here, we assessed the relationship between offspring survival and habitat selection, as well as the use of protective associates, in a system in which sexually selected infanticide (SSI), rather than interspecific predation, affects offspring survival. We used the Scandinavian brown bear (Ursus arctos) population with SSI in a human-dominated landscape as our model system. Bears, especially adult males, generally avoid humans in our study system. We used resource selection functions to contrast habitat selection of GPS-collared mothers that were successful (i.e. surviving litters, n + 19) and unsuccessful (i.e. complete litter loss, n = 11) in keeping their young during the mating season (2005–2012). Habitatselection was indeed a predictor of litter survival. Successful mothers were more likely to use humans as protective associates, whereas unsuccessful mothers avoided humans. Our results suggest that principles of predator–prey and fear ecology theory (e.g. non-consumptive and cascading effects) can also be applied to the context of sexual conflict.},

abstract = {Aging, or senescence, defined as a decline in physiological function with age, has long been a focus of research interest for evolutionary biologists. How has natural selection failed to remove genetic effects responsible for such reduced fitness among older individuals? Current evolutionary theory explains this phenomenon by showing that, as a result of the risk of death from environmental causes that individuals experience, the force of selection inevitably weakens with age [1-3]. This in turn means that genetic mutations having detrimental effects that are only felt late in life might persist in a population. Although widely accepted, this theory rests on the assumption that there is genetic variation for aging in natural systems [4, 5], or (equivalently), that genotype-by-age interactions (GxA) occur for fitness. To date, empirical support for this assumption has come almost entirely from laboratory studies on invertebrate systems, most notably Drosophila and C. elegans [6-10], whereas tests of genetic variation for aging are largely lacking from natural populations [5]. By using data from two wild mammal populations, we perform quantitative genetic analyses of fitness and provide the first evidence for a genetic basis of senescence to come from a study in the natural environment. We find evidence that genetic differences among individuals cause variation in their rates of aging and that additive genetic variance for fitness increases with age, as predicted by the evolutionary theory of senescence. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

Environmental quality can play a key role in shaping immune responses in the wild, as it influences both resource availability and costly maintenance functions. The aim of this study is to evaluate the effect of habitat quality on proinflammatory response to phytohemagglutinin (PHA) in Tree Swallows (Tachycineta bicolor (Vieillot, 1808)) under contrasting agricultural practices. Specifically, we tested the hypothesis that lower quality habitat (intensive agricultural practices and low temperature) negatively impairs immune responses. To do so, we compared the response to PHA of adult female and nestling Tree Swallows nesting in intensive vs. nonintensive agricultural landscapes over 3 years (2008–2010). In accordance with our predictions, we found that habitat quality affected adult female responses to PHA. The response of adult females was significantly higher in nonintensive agricultural areas than in intensive ones. The level of agricultural intensity, however, had no influence on the response to PHA of nestlings. Our results suggest that female adults can buffer the negative impact of a low-quality habitat on their nestlings. Furthermore, our results suggest that under limiting conditions, individuals may have to trade between immunity and other functions such as parental effort.},

abstract = {Environmental conditions during early development, from conception to sexual maturity, can have lasting consequences on fitness components. Although adult life span often accounts for much of the variation in fitness in long-lived animals, we know little about how early environment affects adult life span in the wild, and even less about whether these effects differ between the sexes. Using data collected over 45 years from wild bighorn sheep (Ovis canadensis), we investigated the effects of early environment on adult mortality in both sexes, distinguishing between natural and anthropogenic sources of mortality. We used the average body mass of yearlings (at about 15 months of age) as a yearly index of environmental quality. We first examined sex differences in natural mortality responses to early environment by censoring harvested males in the year they were shot. We then investigated sex differences in the effects of early environment on overall mortality (natural and hunting mortality combined). Finally, we used path analysis to separate the direct influence of early environment from indirect influences, mediated by age at first reproduction, adult mass and horn length. As early environmental conditions improved, natural adult mortality decreased in both sexes, although for males the effect was not statistically supported. Sex differences in the effects of early environment on adult mortality were detected only when natural and hunting mortality were pooled. Males that experienced favourable early environment had longer horns as adults and died earlier because of trophy hunting, which does not mimic natural mortality. Females that experienced favourable early environment started to reproduce earlier and early primiparity was associated with reduced mortality, suggesting a silver-spoon effect. Our results show that early conditions affect males and females differently because of trophy hunting. These findings highlight the importance of considering natural and anthropogenic environmental factors across different life stages to understand sex differences in mortality.},

Survival was not influenced by the exceptionally high mean daily temperature recorded during some periods. Male lamb survival (0.68) tended to be less than female survival (0.81), although not significantly, possibly because of a low sample size. The high lamb mortality (25.7{\%}) recorded during a four-month period is much higher than previous estimates of first-year mortality (less than 10{\%}). We recommend accounting for climatic variation in summer when studying the population dynamics of ungulates. {\textcopyright} 2004 The Royal Society.},

@article{Pelletier2006a,
abstract = {Survival and mating success are key fitness components of mammalian males. Because energy is limited, life history theory predicts trade-offs between current and future reproduction. While many studies have examined fitness trade-off in females, we know little about trade-offs faced by males. In polygynous species, male mating success is largely dependent upon intrasexual competition. Consequently, males have greater uncertainty over the benefits of a given allocation than over its costs, and the correlation between mating effort and success is likely much weaker in males than in females. We analyzed 14 years of data on the mating effort and survival of marked bighorn rams to investigate fitness trade-offs. Dominant rams defended single estrous ewes ("tending") while subordinates attempted to copulate after separating the tending pair ("coursing"). We estimated the participation in tending and coursing for each ram and the effort in searching for breeding opportunities by each ram each year. We compared these three behavioral indices of male mating effort to demographic parameters, individual characteristics, and both yearly and long-term survival. Mating effort during the rut was unrelated to ram overwinter survival, but longevity was positively correlated with mating effort between 2 and 5 years of age. Persistent variation among rams is likely to explain this pattern, suggesting that in natural populations a few high quality males enjoy both high mating success and high survival. {\textcopyright} Springer-Verlag 2006.},
